<h3>DISCONTENTED RECRUITS.</h3>


<p>"Captain, this thing must be stopped. I say
it must be stopped, even if we have to resort
to summary measures. We must find out who the
ringleaders are, and make an example of them."</p>

<p>The speaker was Colonel Brown, the commanding
officer of Fort Lamoine. As he uttered these
emphatic words he slammed a paper-weight down
upon a pile of reports which the adjutant had just
brought in, and, settling back in his chair, looked
sharply at the officer who stood in front of the
table. The red sash the latter wore around his
waist proclaimed him to be the officer of the day.</p>

<p>"How many did you say there were in the party
who deserted last night?" continued the colonel.</p>

<p>"Seven, sir," replied the officer of the day, "and
there is a list of their names. They took no horses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
with them, but they each secured a carbine and a
box of cartridges."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p006.jpg" alt="p006" title="illus_032b"/></div>
<div class="figcenter"><span class="caption"><span class="smcap">An Unexpected Guest.</span></span></div>

<p>"That makes thirty men who have deserted since
I took command of this post," said the colonel, angrily,
"and not more than half of them have been
captured.&mdash;Orderly, tell Corporal Owens I want to
see him. He is one of the few non-commissioned
officers in the command whom I am not afraid to
trust.&mdash;Captain, have six picked men, with two
days' rations, detailed to go with him in pursuit of
these deserters. He can find and arrest them if
anybody can."</p>

<p>The officer of the day closed the door of the colonel's
head-quarters behind him, and in a few minutes
the orderly opened it again to admit a sturdy
young soldier, about eighteen years old, who wore
upon his arms the yellow <i>chevrons</i> of a corporal of
cavalry. This was Bob Owens&mdash;the boy who stole
the <i>mail-carrier's</i> hard-earned money and ran away
from home to enjoy it. He had not changed much
in appearance. He had grown taller and his shoulders
were broader, but any one who had known him
before he entered the army would have recognized
him now. The fact that he had been selected to
perform the hazardous duty of pursuing and arrest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>ing
the deserters who had left the fort the night
before fully armed, and who would not hesitate to
make a desperate resistance rather than allow themselves
to be taken back to stand the punishment that
would be inflicted upon them by a court-martial, and
the colonel's declaration that he was one of the few
non-commissioned officers in the command whom he
was not afraid to trust, seemed to indicate that our
old friend Bob had won a reputation since he enlisted
in Galveston, nearly a year ago, and done
something to win the confidence of his superiors.
Let us go back and see what it was.</p>

<p>The last time we saw Bob Owens he was just
coming out of a recruiting-office, having enlisted in
the regular cavalry and sworn away his liberty for
a long term of years. He did not take this step of
his own free will, but was driven to it by force of
circumstances.</p>

<p>When Bob found Dan Evans in his camp in the
woods and stole from him the money that David,
with Dan and Bert Gordon's assistance, had earned
by trapping quails, he ran away from home, and
after escaping from the constable who arrested him
at Linwood on suspicion of being a horse-thief he
took passage on board the steamer Sam Kendall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
for St. Louis. While he was on the steamer
he made the acquaintance of George Ackerman,
who was one of the pilots, and whom he twice
saved from drowning. George owned an extensive
cattle-ranche in Texas, which was held in
trust for him by his uncle, John Ackerman, who
was his guardian. After the Sam Kendall was
burned he tried to show his gratitude to his preserver,
whom he believed to be alone in the world,
by offering him a home at his house. At first Bob
was inclined to refuse. His imagination having
been excited by the cheap novels he had read, he
had left home intending to go on the Plains and
make himself famous as a hunter and Indian-fighter;
but George, who had seen more than one
professional hunter in his frontier home, said so
much against it, and painted the poverty and
worthlessness of this class of men, and the dangers
of the life they led, in such gloomy colors, that Bob
was finally induced to give up his long-cherished
idea, and to consent to accompany his new friend to
his home in Texas. As George had no money, Bob
footed all their bills, and in due time, in spite of the
efforts which Uncle John Ackerman made to separate
them in New Orleans, they arrived in Galveston.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>They had scarcely stepped ashore before their
troubles began in earnest. Bob's pocket was picked
while he was passing through the crowd on the
wharf, and the boys found themselves alone in a
strange city, without money enough in their possession
to pay for supper or lodging, and no friend
to whom they could go for assistance. They spent
the night on the streets, keeping constantly in motion
to avoid attracting the attention of the police,
and when morning came they found a good-natured
grocer who gave them a breakfast of crackers and
cheese, and provided George with the means of
writing to Mr Gilbert for money to pay his fare
and Bob's by rail and stage-coach to Palos. If
they could only reach that place, their troubles
would be over, for George was well known there,
and everybody would be ready to lend him and his
new friend a helping hand. But Mr. Gilbert lived
a long way from Galveston, the mail facilities between
Palos and his rancho were none of the best,
and the boys were utterly at a loss to determine
how they were going to exist during the two or
three weeks that must elapse before George could
receive an answer to his letter.</p>

<p>The two friends passed the day in roaming about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the city looking for work, but nobody needed them.
When the afternoon began drawing to a close they
were almost tired out, and George talked of going
to some station-house to spend the night&mdash;a project
to which Bob could not bear to listen. The
idea of having a policeman's key turned upon him
was dreadful; the bare thought of it was enough
to make him gasp for breath. As he walked along
the streets he was continually searching his pockets
in the faint hope of finding the missing money
tucked away in some unexplored corner, and finally
he discovered fifty cents in currency in the watch-pocket
of his trousers. His heart bounded at the
sight of it. It was enough to provide him with
supper and a night's lodging, but was not enough
to pay for the same comforts for George.</p>

<p>When Bob found this stray piece of currency he
was not long in making up his mind how to act.
He resolved to slip away from George, and accomplished
his purpose by gradually slackening his pace
and allowing the young pilot to get some distance
in advance of him, and then he turned down a
cross-street and took to his heels. He made his
way to a cheap lodging-house, ate a hearty supper
and went to bed, wondering how George was get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>ting
on and where he would pass the night. The
latter, as we know, fared much better than Bob did,
and the latter made a great mistake in deserting
him. His companion had not been gone more
than a half an hour before George encountered Mr.
Gilbert, the friend to whom he had written that
morning, and who had come to Galveston on business.
The two looked everywhere for Bob, but
were finally obliged to abandon the search. The
missing boy had disappeared as completely as
though the earth had opened and swallowed him
up.</p>

<p>The first question that forced itself upon the mind
of Bob Owens when he awoke the next morning
was, "What shall I do next?" A careful examination
of all his pockets showed him that there were
no more fifty-cent pieces in them, and he was obliged
to confess to himself that the future looked exceedingly
dark. He walked the streets in a very disconsolate
frame of mind, and had almost decided
that he would step into the nearest grocery-store and
ask the proprietor if he would not give him a job
of sawing wood to pay for something to eat, when
he happened to pass a recruiting-office. A sign
posted up in front of the door conveyed to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
public the information that men were wanted there
for the United States cavalry service, and suggested
an idea to Bob. He took a few minutes in which
to run it over in his mind, and then faced about
and entered the office.</p>

<p>The law against enlisting minors without the
consent of their parents or guardians is very strict,
but Bob got around it by repeating the story he
had told George Ackerman, that he was an orphan,
and that there was no one who had a right to control
his actions. The recruiting-officer was a young
man, not more than two or three years older than
himself, but he had seen service away up in the
Yellowstone country, and the scar on his forehead,
which was not yet fully healed, marked the track
of the Indian bullet which had come very near
putting an end to his career as a soldier. Being
unable to do duty in the field, he had been sent to
Texas to recuperate his health and to recruit men
to fill up some of the depleted cavalry regiments.
He questioned Bob very closely, but the latter gave
satisfactory replies, and, having passed the surgeon,
his "descriptive list" was taken and he was duly
sworn into the service. There were a number of
newly-enlisted men hanging about the office wait<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>ing
to be ordered to some post, and one of them,
who acted as quartermaster-sergeant, took Bob into
a back room and served out a uniform to him.</p>

<p>"What shall I do with my citizen's rig?" asked
Bob as he twisted himself first on one side and then
on the other to see how he looked in his new clothes.
"I suppose I can't keep it?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," was the sergeant's quick reply.
"It would come too handy in case you should make
up your mind to desert."</p>

<p>"I shall never make up my mind to any such
thing," exclaimed Bob, indignantly. "I have gone
into this business with my eyes open, and I am going
to see it through."</p>

<p>"That's the right spirit," said the sergeant. "But
wait till you have ridden twelve hundred miles at a
stretch in pursuit of a band of hostiles, and perhaps
you'll weaken."</p>

<p>"What do you know about hostiles?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"Well, I should think I ought to know all about
them, for I have been there. This is my third enlistment
in the regular army."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" exclaimed Bob. "I should think
that after so many years' service you ought to be an
officer."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was a non-com when I was discharged, and
that is as high as any enlisted man can get now,"
replied the soldier. "I was a captain during the
war, but they don't take men out of the ranks and
make officers of them any more. When I enlisted
this time I had to go in as a private; but I have
my old warrants in my pocket, and perhaps they
will help me get a new one when I reach the post
where I am to serve."</p>

<p>"What's a non-com?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"Why, a non-commissioned officer," answered
the soldier, staring at Bob as if he were surprised
at his ignorance. "You never did any soldiering,
I'll bet."</p>

<p>"No, I never did," replied the recruit; "this is
my first experience."</p>

<p>"And before you get through with it you will
wish that you had never had any experience at
all."</p>

<p>"Don't you think I shall like the army?"</p>

<p>"Well, I know <i>I</i> don't like it."</p>

<p>"Then why did you enlist again?"</p>

<p>"Because I couldn't do anything else. A man
who has soldiered for nearly fourteen years isn't fit
for civil life. Now, make your citizen's clothes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
into a bundle and take them around the corner to
a little Jew store you will find there. Mose buys
all the recruits' cast-off clothing. He'll not give
you much for them, but the little he will give you
will keep you in gingerbread as long as you stay
in the city."</p>

<p>"How long do you suppose that will be?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I don't know, but if recruits keep
coming in as rapidly as they have during the last
few days, the lieutenant will probably take a squad
off next week."</p>

<p>"Where will he take it?"</p>

<p>"That's a conundrum. A private never knows
where he is going until he gets there."</p>

<p>"Where do you eat and sleep?"</p>

<p>"We take our meals at the restaurant next door,
and having no bunks we sleep on the benches in
the office. You can go about the city as much as
you please, but you must be sure and report at
meal-time. If you fail to do that, you will have
the police after you."</p>

<p>"Why will I?" asked Bob in surprise.</p>

<p>"Because the lieutenant will think you have
deserted."</p>

<p>Bob was beginning to feel the tight rein of mil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>itary
discipline already. At home he had always
been accustomed to go and come when he pleased,
and he did not like the idea of having his liberty
restricted or of being obliged to obey without
question the orders of a boy scarcely older than
himself. But it was too late to think of that
now. The youthful officer was backed up by the
entire military and police force of the United
States, and there was no such thing as getting out
of reach of his authority.</p>

<p>"I am in for it," thought Bob as he rolled up
his clothes and started for the little Jew store
around the corner, "but I don't know that I could
have done anything else. I shall have plenty to
eat and a place to sleep, and at the same time
I shall be earning money to pay off that debt I
owe Dave Evans. What an idiot I was to keep
that money! To pay for that one act of folly and
dishonesty I am compelled to waste some of the
best years of my life in the army. I hope I shall
get a chance to show them that I am no coward,
if I am a greenhorn."</p>

<p>It was little indeed that Mose gave Bob for the
articles he had to offer for sale&mdash;just four dollars
for clothing that had cost over thirty; but those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
four dollars made him feel a little more independent.
They brought him a few delicacies to supplement
the plain fare that was served up to him
and his companions at the cheap restaurant at
which they took their meals, and were the means
of gaining him the friendship of one of the recruits,
Bristow by name, who stuck to him like a leech
until the last cent had been expended.</p>

<p>Bob remained in Galveston nearly two weeks,
and during that time he saw everything of interest
there was to be seen in the city. Then he began
to grow tired of having nothing to do, and took
to hanging about the office as the others did, and
making comments upon those who presented themselves
for enlistment. He was glad indeed when
the lieutenant mustered all the recruits one night
and ordered them to report at the office the next
morning at nine o'clock, sharp; but he was provoked
because the officer did not tell them where
they were going. This, however, only proved the
truth of the old sergeant's words&mdash;that a private
never knew where he was going until he got there.
Bob knew that they were bound for Brownsville
when a steamer landed them there a few hours later,
and he found out that they were going from there to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Fort Lamoine when they arrived at that post after
a weary tramp of more than three hundred miles.</p>

<p>The recruits camped beside the trail at night,
and during the daytime plodded along behind the
army-wagon which contained their tents, blankets,
rations and cooking-utensils. It was very fatiguing
to all of them, and it was not long before Bob
began to learn something of the dispositions of the
men with whom he was to be intimately associated
during his term of enlistment. The majority of
them grumbled lustily, and even talking of deserting,
and there were not more than two or three
besides himself who bore the discomforts of the
march with anything like patience. There was not
much restriction placed upon their actions, and, although
they were not permitted to stray away from
the line of march during the daytime, they were
allowed to visit any ranches or farm-houses that
might be in the neighborhood of their camping-grounds.
The people they met along the route
were very liberal with the products of their gardens
and with their milk, butter and eggs, and the
recruits fared sumptuously every day; but it would
have been much better for some of them if they
had remained in camp at night and left the settlers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
entirely alone. Not a few of the men with whom
they exchanged civilities unconsciously sowed among
them seeds of discontent that were destined eventually
to bear a fruitful crop of trouble. By endeavoring
to live up to the sentiments they heard expressed
on every hand, more than one of the recruits
found themselves landed in the military
prison at Fort Leavenworth.</p>

<p>"I don't see why you chaps swear away your
liberty, and work for thirteen dollars a month,
when you might just as well get forty and be free
men," said a rancheman one night, after he has
given Bob and three companions, one of whom was
Bristow, all the milk he had to spare. "You'll
soon get enough of soldiering, <i>I</i> tell you. I know,
for I have tried it. It is a heap easier to ride
around on your horse and watch your cattle while
they are fattening themselves for market on the
rich grass."</p>

<p>"But we don't happen to have any cattle to
watch," said Bob.</p>

<p>"Who would give us forty dollars a month?"
demanded Bristow, who was one of the loudest and
most persistent grumblers among the recruits.</p>

<p>"You could get it almost anywhere in this coun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>try,"
replied the rancheman. "I'd give it to you, for
one, and I know of a dozen others who stand ready
to snap up the first man that comes along, no odds
whether he ever herded cattle or not. You have
made precious fools of yourselves, and you'll get a
fool's reward. You'll have mean grub, hard work
and poor pay, and be niggers to every little snipe
who wears a shoulder-strap."</p>

<p>"We've found that out already&mdash;haven't we,
boys?" said Bristow, as he and his companions reluctantly
took leave of the hospitable rancheman
and retraced their steps toward the camp. "We <i>are</i>
precious fools to work for thirteen dollars, when
we might just as well earn three times that amount,
and be our own masters besides. There is no need
that anybody should tell us that our officers will
treat us like niggers, for we have found that out
too. Look at that lieutenant! He rides in the
wagon every day, while we have to hoof it."</p>

<p>"But you must remember that he is not strong,"
said Bob. "He has not yet fully recovered from
the effects of his wound."</p>

<p>"I don't believe a word of it," declared Bristow.
"He's just as able to march and cook his own grub
and pitch his own tent as we are. It makes me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
sick to see how that man Haskins waits on him."
(Haskins was the one who had served out clothing
to the recruits in Galveston.) "But a blind man
could see what he is working for," added Bristow.
"He wants to get into the good graces of the lieutenant,
hoping that he will be recommended for a
non-com's position when we reach the fort. I tell
you I have seen enough of soldiering already, and
the very first chance I get I am going to skip out."</p>

<p>"I'll go with you," said one of the recruits.</p>

<p>"All right! Shake on that."</p>

<p>"You may depend upon me," said the recruit
as he grasped Bristow's proffered hand. "Do you
remember that big-whiskered, loud-voiced rancheman
who gave us the potatoes the other night? He
is sadly in need of help, and he told me that if I
would come to his house, bringing three or four
friends with me, he would give us citizens' clothes
and hide us until the officers gave up looking for
us. All he asked was, that we should agree to
work for him for twelve months, and promise not
to leave without giving him due notice."</p>

<p>"I am in for that," exclaimed the recruit who
had not spoken before.&mdash;"What do you say,
Owens?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"I say I am <i>out</i> of it," was the quick reply.
"If I did a thing like that, I never could look a
white man in the face again. I have been guilty
of a good many mean acts during my life&mdash;some
that I would gladly recall if I could&mdash;but I am
not mean enough to desert. Besides, I have no
desire to have a bullet sent into me."</p>

<p>Bob's companions did not know whether to be
surprised or angry at this plain speech. They stared
hard at him for a moment, and then Bristow said,</p>

<p>"Are you really afraid of being shot? Well, I
can set your fears on that score at rest. I know
that the penalty for desertion in the face of the
enemy is death, but we are not in the face of the
enemy now. The country is at peace."</p>

<p>"I know it is nominally so," answered Bob,
"but it is not so in reality, and never will be so
long as these hostile Indians and lawless Mexicans
continue to raid over the Texas border. If you
skip out, as you threaten to do, you may rest assured
that you will be brought back by force of
arms, and if you resist you will be shot."</p>

<p>"How does it come that you know so much
more than the rest of us?" demanded Bristow angrily.
"You are not an old soldier."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am aware of that fact, but I have been talking
to an old soldier, and that was Haskins. He
told me that Major Elliot, one of General Custer's
officers, pursued a party of deserters, and when they
resisted he shot three of them; and Haskins himself
was one of the squad that did the shooting."</p>

<p>"I don't believe a word of it," exclaimed
Bristow.</p>

<p>"Neither do I," said another of the recruits.
"Of course we expect to be pursued, but we shall
take good care that we are not caught. Any of
these ranchemen who want herdsmen will furnish
us with citizens' clothing, and before our year is
out the thing will blow over, and then we'll go
home, and stay there."</p>

<p>"It won't blow over as easily as you think for,"
said Bob. "It will be known to your home authorities
and to everybody else that you are deserters,
and all the detectives in the United States will
be on the lookout for you. If you want to live in
constant fear of arrest, you can do it, but I won't."</p>

<p>Bob stuck to his resolution, and his discontented
companions stuck to theirs. We shall see in due
time which of the four made the wisest decision.</p>

<h3>AN OLD FRIEND TURNS UP.</h3>


<p>The long, toilsome journey was completed at
last, and late one afternoon the weary and
footsore recruits found themselves drawn up in line
on the parade-ground at Fort Lamoine. After the
roll had been called and the colonel commanding
the post had hurriedly inspected them, they were
turned over to a sergeant, who marched them into the
barracks. There they found about two hundred or
more soldiers, who, as soon as the order was given
to "break ranks," crowded about them inquiring for
late papers and asking a thousand and one questions
in regard to what was going on in the States.</p>

<p>Learning from the sergeant that no duty would
be required of him that day, Bob spread his blankets
in one of the empty bunks, and, stretching
himself upon them, placed his hands under his head
and looked about him with no little curiosity.
Presently a young trooper, a boy about his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
age, who looked as though he were just recovering
from a long siege of sickness, approached, and, seating
himself on the edge of Bob's bunk, began a
conversation with him. Those of our readers
who have met this boy before in citizen's dress
might have seen something familiar about him, but
still it is doubtful if they would have recognized in
him&mdash;Well, we will let him reveal his identity.
After a few commonplace remarks Bob inquired,
as he nodded his head toward a soldier who was
hobbling about the room with the aid of a crutch,</p>

<p>"What's the matter with that man?"</p>

<p>"Raiders," was the sententious reply.</p>

<p>"Been in a fight?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>The young soldier nodded his head.</p>

<p>"How long since?"</p>

<p>"Last full moon."</p>

<p>"I hope these fights don't occur very often."</p>

<p>"Well, they do&mdash;much oftener than I wish they
did. I have been in two pretty hard ones, and
that's enough for me. I suppose we shall have
more of them now, for I understand that we have
received orders to follow the raiders across the river
and thrash them wherever they can be found."</p>

<p>"Were you wounded in one of those fights?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
asked Bob. "Then you must be sick," he added
when the boy shook his head.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sick," was the reply&mdash;"homesick
and sick at heart. I have been in the army nearly
two years and a half, and I don't see how I can
live to serve out the rest of my time. I am dying
by inches."</p>

<p>"What did you come into the army for, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Because I was a fool," answered the young
soldier bitterly.</p>

<p>"Shake," exclaimed Bob, extending his hand;
"I came in for the same reason."</p>

<p>"Did your parents give their consent?" asked
his new acquaintance.</p>

<p>"No, they didn't. They live in Mississippi,
and don't know anything about it."</p>

<p>Bob's long tramp had taken a good deal of spirit
out of him, and somehow he could not muster up
energy enough to tell any more falsehoods concerning
himself.</p>

<p>"My parents live in Ohio," said the soldier.</p>

<p>"Then how in the world did you happen to stray
down here to Texas?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"I ran away from home."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shake," said Bob, again extending his hand;
"that's just what I did."</p>

<p>The two runaways shook each other's hands in
the most cordial manner, and instantly all reserve
between them vanished. They were companions in
misery and united by a bond of sympathy. The
young soldier at once became very communicative.
He had closely guarded his secret for more than
two years, because there was not one among the
rough men by whom he was surrounded who could
understand or appreciate his feelings. But here was
one who could sympathize with him, and it was a
great relief to him to know that he could speak
freely and run no risk of being laughed at for his
weakness.</p>

<p>"My name is Gus Robbins," said he, moving up
a little closer to Bob and speaking in a low, confidential
tone. "I had as good a home as any boy
need wish for, but I wasn't contented there; still,
I don't believe that I ever should have left it as I
did if circumstances had not smoothed the way for
me. My father is the senior partner in the largest
dry-goods store in Foxboro', and he had in his employ
two persons, father and son, who are in a great
measure responsible for all the trouble I have got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
into. The buy was a clerk like myself, and his father
was our bookkeeper. They had a very wealthy
relative, a rancheman, living here in Texas, and
when that relative died it was found that he had
willed his property to our bookkeeper, to be held in
trust for his (the rancheman's) son. They came to
Texas to take charge of the estate, and after a while I
received a letter from Ned (that was the boy's name)
inviting me to pay him a visit. As he sent me
money enough to bear the expenses of the journey,
I came; and I am very sorry for it. We got ourselves
into trouble by shooting some cattle that
had broken into Ned's wheat-field, and had to dig
out for Brownsville at a gallop. Ned went squarely
back on me, and as I had no money to pay my way
home, and hadn't the cheek to ask my father for it,
I did what I thought to be the next best thing&mdash;I
enlisted. I am very sorry for that too, for there
was where I made my mistake. I ought to have
gone back into the country and hired out to some
stock-raiser. Then I could have gone home as
soon as I had earned and saved money enough to
take me there; but now I must stay my time out;
that is, unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>Gus paused and looked at Bob. The latter un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>derstood
him. Here was another fellow who had
made up his mind to desert at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>"Don't do that," said Bob, earnestly. "You'll
only get yourself into trouble if you attempt it."</p>

<p>"I don't care if I am shot for it. I'll make a
break for liberty the very first good chance I get."</p>

<p>The tone in which these words were uttered satisfied
Bob that it would be of no use whatever to
argue the matter. It was plain that Gus had made
up his mind after mature deliberation, and that he
was not to be easily turned from his purpose.</p>

<p>"Where did your friend Ned go after you reached
Brownsville?" asked Bob, who was much interested
in the young soldier's story.</p>

<p>"I don't know; I left him at the hotel. He
will come to some bad end, and so will his father,
for they are both rascals. The property of which
they have charge, and which brings in a big fortune
every year, rightfully belongs to George
Ackerman, Ned's cousin; but Ned and his father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"George Ackerman?" exclaimed Bob, starting
up in his bunk.</p>

<p>Gus nodded his head, and looked at the recruit
in great surprise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is he a cub pilot?" continued the latter.</p>

<p>"'A cub pilot'?" repeated Gus. "No, he's a
herdsman, or I ought rather to say he <i>was</i> a herdsman.
He had stock of his own worth six thousand
dollars. Where he is now I don't know, for
on the morning after we left his ranche, while we
were camped in the edge of the timber making up
for the sleep we had lost the night before, we were
surprised by a couple of Greasers, who made a prisoner
of George and carried him across the river
into Mexico. I don't know what they did with
him, for all George could induce them to say was
that 'Fletcher wanted to see him.'"</p>

<p>"It's the same fellow," exclaimed Bob, rising
from his blanket and seating himself on the edge
of the bunk by his companion's side. "He told me
all about it, but his story was so very remarkable
that I didn't know whether to believe it or not.
He gave those Greasers the slip, secured a berth as
cub pilot on a Mississippi River steamer, and that
was where I found him."</p>

<p>With this introduction Bob went on to tell how
he had saved George from going to the bottom
when Uncle John Ackerman pushed him overboard
from the Sam Kendall; related all the thrill<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>ing
incidents connected with the burning of the
steamer; described how Uncle John had tried to
separate them in New Orleans; in short, he gave
a truthful account of his intercourse with the cub
pilot up to the time he deserted him in Galveston.
Bob was heartily ashamed of that now, and could
not bear to speak of it.</p>

<p>"I became separated from him in some way&mdash;it
is very easy to lose a companion in the crowded
streets of a city, you know&mdash;and that was the last
I saw of him," said Bob in conclusion; and when
he told this he forgot that he had afterward seen
George go into a hotel accompanied by Mr. Gilbert.
"Then I didn't know what to do. I had no
money; I was hungry and sleepy, utterly discouraged;
and, like you, I sought to end my troubles
by enlisting. I see now that I made a great mistake,
but I am going to serve faithfully during my
term of enlistment, if I live. Is George's ranche
far from here?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, for I am not much acquainted
with the country east of here, never having scouted
in that direction. It is about one hundred and
fifty miles from Palos, if you know where that is.
As you are George's friend, I am sorry that you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
enlisted, for I know that you are going to have a
hard time of it; but since you <i>did</i> enlist, I am
glad you were ordered to this post, for misery loves
company, you know. Let's walk out on the parade,
where we can talk without danger of being
overheard. Perhaps you would like to take a look
at the place which will always be associated in your
mind with the most unhappy days of your existence."</p>

<p>It was plain that Gus took a very gloomy view
of things, and of course his discouraging remarks
made an impression upon Bob, although they did
not take away the interest he felt in his surroundings.
Everything was new to him, and he asked
a great many questions as he and Gus walked slowly
around the parade toward the stables.</p>

<p>Fort Lamoine was situated on a high, rocky
eminence which overlooked the surrounding country
for half a dozen miles or more in every direction.
The stockade, which enclosed about two
acres of ground, was built of upright logs deeply
sunk in the earth. The tops were sawed off level,
and a heavy plate of timber, through which stout
wooden pins had been driven into the end of each
log, held them firmly in their place. The officers'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
quarters, barracks, store-houses and stables were
built in the same manner. On the outside of the
parade were long rows of stately cottonwood trees,
interspersed with shrubs and flowers. In one corner,
on the right-hand side of the principal gate,
was the well that supplied the garrison with water,
and in the other was the flagstaff, from which floated
the Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p>"Emblem of liberty!" said Gus with a sneer as
he pointed up at the flag&mdash;"emblem of tyranny,
rather."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" demanded Bob
quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you will find out before you have been
here long," replied Gus, shaking his head and
looking very wise. "A bigger lot of tyrants than
the officers who command us were never crowded
into any one post."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you don't do your duty as well as you
might?" mildly suggested Bob.</p>

<p>"I know I don't. I do no more than I am
obliged to do, I tell you, and for the simple reason
that I didn't enlist to act as lackey to a lot of
shoulder-straps. I am just as good as they are, but
they say I am not. Why, the last time the paymas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>ter
was here his little snipe of a clerk remarked in
my hearing that enlisted men were nothing more
than servants to the officers. What do you think
of that?"</p>

<p>Bob did not know what to think of it, so he
said nothing in reply. He simply resolved that he
would not pass judgment upon his superiors until
he had had some experience with them himself.</p>

<p>"This is by no means the gloomy place that I
expected to find it," said Bob as he and Gus resumed
their walk.</p>

<p>"Oh, the fort itself is good enough," replied
Gus; "it's the people who live in it that I object
to. If one could pick his own company, and could
do as he pleased, he might manage to live here for
a few years very comfortably; but we have to associate
with some rough characters there in the barracks,
and the officers hold us with our noses close
to the grindstone all the time. They look upon a
private as little better than a dog, and they'll slap
him into the guard-house on the slightest provocation.
Now, this is one of the stables; it will
accommodate seventy horses. Those you see in
here are blooded animals, and they belong to the
officers. The government horses are always picket<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>ed
outside, except when there is danger of a visit
from the raiders, and then they are brought in for
safe-keeping. Now, take a good look at the stable,
and then come out and take another look at the
stockade. Every night there are two sentries placed
over this stable&mdash;one at the front, and the other at
the rear, between the stable and the stockade&mdash;and
a guard sleeps inside. Would you believe that, after
all these precautions, it would be possible for anybody
to come into the fort and steal a horse?"</p>

<p>Bob said he would not.</p>

<p>"Well, it was done not more than two weeks
ago," continued Gus. "One stormy night these
two logs were removed from the stockade, and four
of the best horses in the stable were run off. It
must have taken hours to do the work, and although
the sentries were changed while it was going
on, no one knew that a theft had been committed
until the next morning."</p>

<p>"Who did it?" inquired Bob.</p>

<p>"A couple of Comanches, who were surprised
and killed by the squad that was sent in pursuit
of them. The Comanches are acknowledged, even
by the Indians themselves, to be the most expert
horse-thieves on the Plains. Why, one night, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
a scouting-party to which I was attached were in
camp and fast asleep, a Comanche crept up and
stole the lieutenant's horse; and in order to do
it he had to cut the lariat that was tied to the officer's
wrist. He got away with the horse, and
never awoke one of us."</p>

<p>Gus Robbins had accumulated an almost inexhaustible
fund of such anecdotes as these during
his two and a half years of army-life, and he related
a good many of them to Bob while they were
walking about the fort examining the different objects
of interest. From some of them Bob gained
a faint idea of what might be in store for himself.</p>

<p>The next morning the newly-arrived recruits
were formed into an awkward squad and turned
over to the tender mercies of a grizzly old sergeant,
who proved to be anything but an agreeable and
patient instructor. He drilled them for four hours
without allowing them a single moment's rest, abusing
them roundly for every mistake they made;
and when at last he marched them to their quarters,
it was only that they might eat their dinner
and take half an hour's breathing-spell preparatory
to going through the same course of sprouts again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
in the afternoon. This routine was followed day
after day until the members of the awkward squad
were declared to be sufficiently drilled to warrant
their appearance on dress-parade. After that they
were assigned to the different troops (or companies)
that stood the most in need of men, Bob, to his
delight, finding himself in the same troop to which
his new friend, Gus Robbins, belonged. But even
then their troubles did not cease. Instead of drilling
eight hours each day, they drilled six, and were
obliged to do guard-duty besides. Among the three
hundred and eighty men who composed the garrison
there were not a few old soldiers who hated this
hard work as cordially as some of the new-comers
did, and there was a good deal of grumbling among
them; but Bob Owens never uttered a word of complaint.
Firmly adhering to the resolution he had
made when he first enlisted, he set himself to work
to learn just what was required of him, and when
he found out what his duty was, he did it cheerfully
and faithfully. He was always on hand when
he was wanted, his equipments were always ready
for inspection, and his horse shone like satin.
When his own steed had been fed and groomed, he
turned his attention to the horse belonging to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
lieutenant who commanded the troop to which he
belonged, and thereby aroused the indignation of
some of his brother-soldiers.</p>

<p>"What are you doing that for?" demanded
Gus Robbins one day as he and Bristow entered
the stable and found Bob busy at work grooming
the lieutenant's horse. "You are in pretty business,
I must say!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I rather like it," answered Bob. "I always
liked to work about horses, and I am doing this
because I haven't anything else to do just now."</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't do it any more if I were in
your place," continued Gus. "The law expressly
prohibits an officer from compelling, or even
hiring, an enlisted man to do his dirty work."</p>

<p>"It does, does it?" exclaimed Bob. "Didn't
you tell me when I just came here that enlisted
men were nothing but servants to their officers?"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that, exactly," stammered Gus.
"What I <i>did</i> mean was, that they don't treat us
like human beings. If an officer wants a servant,
he must hire a civilian and pay him out of his
own pocket; that's what the law says."</p>

<p>"I am aware of that fact; but the law doesn't
say that I shall not groom the lieutenant's horse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
if I choose to do it of my own free will, does
it?"</p>

<p>"Let the toady alone, Robbins," said Bristow
angrily. "The troop hasn't got all the non-coms
that it is entitled to, and Owens is working for
chevrons. You know the lieutenant said the
other day that there were four corporals' and two
duty sergeants' warrants waiting for those who
were willing to win them; and this is the way
Owens is going to work to get one of them."</p>

<p>Bob straightened up, looked sharply at Bristow
for a moment, and then drew back the brush he
held in his hand, as if he had half a mind to throw
it at his head.</p>

<p>"That's what all the boys say, Bob," observed
Gus. "If you want to keep on the right side
of the privates, you must not try to curry favor
with the officers."</p>

<p>"If you want a non-com's warrant, why don't
you wait until you get a chance to win it in battle?"
added Bristow. "That's what I intend to
do, and I shall think much more of a promotion
earned in that way than I should of one I had
gained by cleaning an officer's horse."</p>

<p>"Look here, fellows," said Bob earnestly: "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
don't do this work for the lieutenant because I
hope to gain anything by it. I do it simply to
pass away the time, for I can't see any fun in
loafing about the quarters doing nothing. If
the boys don't like it, let's see them help themselves."</p>

<p>"If the lieutenant was a decent man, I wouldn't
say a word," answered Bristow. "But he is so
mean that I wouldn't turn my hand over to save
his life."</p>

<p>"Anybody with half an eye could see what is
the matter with you," retorted Bob. "You have
been in the guard-house about half the time since
you have been here, and spent the other half in
doing extra duty; and that's the reason you don't
like the lieutenant. If you will wake up and attend
to business, he will treat you well enough."</p>

<p>Bob's prompt and soldier-like way of performing
the work that was required of him very soon
attracted the attention of Lieutenant Earle (that
was the name of the officer in command of the
troop to which Bob belonged), and he took his
own way to reward him for it. If he was ordered
off on a scout, Bob Owens was always one of the
"picked men" who accompanied him. If he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
sent out with a squad during the full of the moon
to watch the ford a few miles below the fort, Bob
was one of the members of that squad. This did
not excite the jealousy of the good soldiers, for
they were always glad to have a brave comrade
to back them up in times of danger, no matter
whether he was a greenhorn or a veteran; but
the grumblers and the discontented ones, especially
those who belonged to his own troop, had a good
deal to say about it, and declared that the lieutenant
took Bob with him on his expeditions to pay
him for grooming his horse. They disliked him
cordially, and it was not long before an incident
happened that caused the dislike of at least one
of them to grow into positive hatred.</p>

<p>One pleasant afternoon some of the men received
permission to go outside the gates for a short
stroll. They wandered off in squads, some going
one way and some another, and Bristow and two
companions&mdash;one of whom was Gus Robbins&mdash;bent
their steps toward the crumbling remains of
an old adobe outpost which marked the spot where
more than one desperate fight with the Apaches
had taken place in the days gone by. There they
seated themselves and entered into conversation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Bristow's first words indicating that they were about
to discuss a subject that had before occupied their
attention.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Robbins," said he, "if you are
in earnest in what you say, now is the time to
prove it."</p>

<p>"I certainly am in earnest," answered Gus;
"but, to tell you the honest truth, I am
afraid."</p>

<p>"'Afraid'!" repeated Bristow in a tone of
contempt. "What in the world are you afraid
of?"</p>

<p>"Of pursuit," replied Gus. "If we resist, we
run the risk of being shot; and if we are captured,
we stand an excellent chance of going to
prison."</p>

<p>"Now, Robbins," said Bristow earnestly, "let
me once more explain our arrangements to you,
and you will see that we do not risk anything.
In the first place, the horses are left picketed
outside the stockade every night. They are never
brought in, as you know, unless there is danger
of a visit from the raiders. Four of the six men
who are to act as horse-guards to-night belong to
our party. When the time for action arrives, these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
four men will go to work on the other two and
try to induce them to accompany us. If they don't
succeed, they'll bind and gag them, and so put it
out of their power to give the alarm. The sentry
who will be on duty between the stable and the
stockade is also one of us, and of course he will
raise no objection when we slip out of the quarters,
one by one, and climb the stockade. As fast as
we get over we will select our horses&mdash;I've got
mine picked out, and I could put my hand on him
in the darkest of nights&mdash;and when the last one
has made his escape we'll mount and put off.
Of course we hope to escape by running, but if
we can't do that, we shall turn at bay and make
a fight of it. We have all sworn to stand by one
another to the last, and thirty determined, well-armed
men can make things lively for a while,
I tell you."</p>

<p>Bristow continued to talk in this strain for half
an hour, his companion now and then putting in a
word to assist him; and he talked to such good
purpose that Gus Robbins finally consented to make
one of the large party that was to desert the post
that very night. Bristow then gave him the names
of the other members&mdash;there were several non-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>commissioned
officers among them&mdash;and after urging
him to be very careful of himself, and to say
and do nothing that might arouse the suspicions
of "outsiders," the three got upon their feet and
walked toward the fort.</p>

<p>They had scarcely left the ruins when a fatigue-cap
arose from behind a pile of rubbish scarcely a
dozen feet from the place where the three conspirators
had been sitting, and a pair of eyes looking
out from under the peak of that cap watched
them as they moved away.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">TOP</a></span>
<h3>BOB'S FIRST COMMAND.</h3>


<p>The eyes that were so closely watching the
movements of Bristow and his companions belonged
to Bob Owens. The latter had strolled off
alone, and thrown himself behind an angle of the
ruined wall to indulge in a few moments' quiet
meditation, and thus unwillingly placed himself in
a position to overhear the details of the plot which
we have just disclosed. If Bristow had not so
promptly entered upon the discussion of the subject
of desertion, Bob would have made his presence
known to him; but after he had listened to
the first words that fell from his lips he thought it
best to remain quietly in his place of concealment,
for he knew that if he revealed himself, then he
would be accused of playing the part of eavesdropper.</p>

<p>"Now, here's a go!" thought Bob, rising to his
feet when he saw Bristow and his two friends walk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
through the gate into the fort, "and I wish somebody
would be kind enough to tell me what I
ought to do about it. Shall I stand quietly by and
let them go, or shall I tell the officers what I have
heard? If I let them go, they will run the risk of
being gobbled up by that party of Kiowas who are
now raiding the country north of us; and if I tell
the colonel, and it should ever be found out on me,
I should lead a hard life in the quarters. I wish
I had been somewhere else when they came here."</p>

<p>Thrusting his hands deep into his pockets, Bob
left the ruins, and, walking slowly around the
stockade, entered at a gate on the opposite side.
His first care was to hunt up the sergeant-major
of his regiment, whom he found in the quarters.
This man had grown gray in the service, and he
was a soldier all over&mdash;brave, faithful and untiring
in the performance of his duty. He readily responded
to Bob's significant wink, and followed
him out on the parade.</p>

<p>"Sergeant," said Bob as soon as they were beyond
earshot of everybody, "I have accidentally
come into the possession of a secret, and I don't
know what to do with it. There are thirty men in
the garrison who are going to desert to-night."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>The old fellow took a fresh chew of tobacco,
pushed his cap on the back of his head and looked
at Bob, who, after telling him where he had been
and how he happened to overhear the plot, continued:</p>

<p>"It would never do to let them go. You know
I was detailed to act as the colonel's orderly this
morning, and I heard that scout who came in just
before noon tell him that there is a large party of
hostiles between here and Fort Tyler. These deserters
intend to take their weapons with them,
and think they can make a good fight; but those
Kiowas are strong enough to annihilate them."</p>

<p>"Small loss that would be to us!" growled the
veteran. "We are going to have some hot work
to do before long, and such men are no good in a
fight."</p>

<p>"It would never do to let them go," repeated
Bob, "but there is only one way to prevent it that
I can see; and that is by telling the colonel all
about it. If I do that, and they should find it out,
they would go back on me, sure."</p>

<p>"Of course they would," said the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Well, what would you do if you were in my
place?" asked Bob.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"What would I do? I would go straight to
the officer of the day and tell him the whole thing.
The good-will of such men don't amount to anything,
any way, and what do you care if they do
go back on you? There's only thirty of them,
and that leaves three hundred and fifty good fellows
who will always be ready to befriend you.
Do you know who these deserters are? I'll report
the matter if you are afraid, and then let's see one
of them open his head to me."</p>

<p>Bob repeated the names of the would-be deserters
which Bristow had given as nearly as he could recall
them, and the sergeant hurried off to hunt up
the officer of the day, while Bob went back into
the quarters. He had been there but a few minutes
when the orderly appeared at the door and
sung out,</p>

<p>"Owens, the colonel wants to see you."</p>

<p>"Aha!" exclaimed Bristow, "our good little boy
has been doing something bad at last.&mdash;There are
no bunks in the guard-house, Owens."</p>

<p>Bob made no reply. He followed the orderly
across the parade and into the colonel's head-quarters,
where he found the officer of the day, the
sergeant-major and all the ranking officers of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
garrison. The colonel questioned him closely in
regard to the plot he had discovered, and finally
dismissed him and the sergeant without making
any comments. Half an hour later the entire
cavalry force of the garrison was drawn up in
line, the names of forty men who were ordered to
the front and centre were read off, and the rest of
the troopers were sent back to their quarters.
Then the bugle sounded "Boots and saddles!" and
in a few minutes more these forty men&mdash;one of
whom was Bob Owens&mdash;rode out of the gate, led
by the scout who had brought the information
concerning that war-party of Kiowas. The squad
was commanded by Lieutenant Earle.</p>

<p>"That's all right," whispered Bristow to one of
his fellow-conspirators as they stood in front of their
quarters and saw their comrades ride away. "There
will be just so many men less to follow us to-morrow
morning. But I wish we knew which
way they are going," he added in a tone of anxiety;
"and we must find out if we can. We don't want
to run into them if we can possibly avoid them, for
there are some of the best men in the garrison in
that party."</p>

<p>"I suppose we are off after the hostiles," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the soldier who rode by Bob's side. "The scout
told the colonel that there were three hundred
braves in that party, didn't he?"</p>

<p>Bob answered that that was what he understood
him to say.</p>

<p>"Then I wish we had a hundred men instead
of forty," continued the trooper. "Our squad is
too large to conceal itself, and too small to make a
successful fight against such overwhelming odds.
Well, if worst comes to worst&mdash;"</p>

<p>The speaker thrust his hand into his boot-leg
and drew out a loaded Derringer. He intended
to send its contents through his own head rather
than fall alive into the hands of the hostiles.
Probably nine out of ten men in that squad were
provided with weapons just like it, and which they
intended to use in the same way should circumstances
require it. Veteran Indian-fighters never
fail to give this advice to a recruit: "When it
comes to a fight, save the last shot for yourself."</p>

<p>But, as it happened, Bob and his companions
were not out after hostiles on this particular afternoon,
for that raiding-party of Kiowas was already
beyond the reach of any force that the commander<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
of Fort Lamoine could have sent in pursuit of it.
They found out in due time that their mission
was of an entirely different character. They rode
at a sharp trot until it was nearly dark, and then
they went into camp in a belt of post-oaks and
cooked and ate their supper. After an hour's rest
they mounted and rode back toward the fort again.
Arriving within a mile of the stockade, a halt was
ordered, the men were dismounted, and, every
fourth trooper being left to hold the horses, the
others marched off through the darkness, armed
only with their revolvers. Then Bob began to
understand the matter. The object of the expedition
was to capture the deserters. It had been led
away from the fort simply as a "blind," and in
order to lull the malcontents into a feeling of security
no change whatever had been made in
the guards who were to do duty that night.</p>

<p>After the lieutenant had marched about half a
mile another halt was ordered, and sixteen men,
divided into squads of four men each, were told off
to begin the work. The officer approached each
squad in turn, and after designating some one to
take charge of it, gave him his instructions in a
whisper. When he walked up to Bob he asked,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you know where post No. 4 is? and can
you go straight to it without making any mistake?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, to both your questions," was the
prompt reply.</p>

<p>"Very well. Take command of this squad and
go and arrest Dodd, whom you will find on guard
there. Then put Carey in his place, and come back
and report to me at post No. 1, and I will tell you
what else to do. The countersign," added the lieutenant,
coming a step nearer to Bob and speaking in a
tone so low that no one else could catch his words,
"is 'Custer.' Be quick and still. Forward, march!"</p>

<p>As Bob moved away with his squad he told himself
that fidelity is sometimes appreciated. This
was his first command, and he knew that much depended
upon the way in which he executed the orders
that had been given him. If they were faithfully
and skilfully carried out, he might hope to
be entrusted with other commands in future, and
so be given opportunities to distinguish himself and
win promotion; for Bob, like every ambitious boy,
was anxious to get ahead as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Owens?" asked all the
members of his squad in concert as soon as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
were out of the lieutenant's hearing. They were
all in the dark, and so was every man belonging
to the expedition with the exception of the lieutenant,
the sergeant-major and Bob Owens. The latter
explained the state of affairs in as few words
as he could, and the general verdict was that it
would have been no loss to the garrison, or to the
service either, if Bristow and his companions had
been permitted to depart in peace.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Bob and his men arrived within
sight of the place where the horses were staked
out, and a hoarse voice broke the stillness. "Halt!
Who comes there?" was the challenge.</p>

<p>"Friends, with the countersign," answered Bob
after bringing his squad to a halt.</p>

<p>"Advance, one friend, and give the countersign,"
was the next command.</p>

<p>"Now, boys," said Bob in a low whisper, "you
stay here, and when I call out 'Advance, squad,'
come up briskly and surround Dodd, so as to be
ready to overpower him if he shows the least disposition
to resist or cry out."</p>

<p>So saying, Bob moved off in the direction from
which the hail sounded, and presently discovered
the sentry, who stood at "arms port."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Halt!" commanded the guard when Bob had
approached within a few feet of him. "Give the
countersign."</p>

<p>Bob whispered the magic word.</p>

<p>"The countersign is correct," said the sentry,
bringing his carbine to a carry.&mdash;"It's you, is it,
Owens? What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Advance, squad," said Bob in a low tone.
"You haven't seen anything suspicious going on
about your post, have you?" he added, wishing to
occupy the sentry's attention until his men could
come within supporting distance of him. "No?
Well, I am sorry to say that there is something
suspicious about <i>you</i>, and I am ordered to put you
in arrest."</p>

<p>He laid hold of the carbine as he said this, and
at the same moment two of his men placed their
hands upon the sentinel's shoulders. The latter,
seeing that resistance was useless, promptly gave up
his piece and dropped his hands by his sides. "It's
all that Bristow's work," said he in angry tones.
"I knew he wouldn't do to tie to."</p>

<p>"Don't say too much," interposed Bob. "You
don't want to condemn yourself.&mdash;Carey, take
this post until relieved."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>As Bob marched his squad and his prisoner to the
place where he was to meet his commanding officer,
he found the intervening posts in the charge of
trusty men. Four of the discontented ones had
been secured, and it only remained for the lieutenant
to perfect arrangements for seizing the others as
fast as they came out of the fort. He had already
decided upon his plan of operations, and Bob
Owens was called upon to take the first step toward
carrying it out. After he had listened to some
very explicit instructions from his commander, he
stole off into the darkness, and, creeping along the
outside of the stockade until he reached a point opposite
the place where the sentry was posted behind
the stables, he stopped and waited to see what was
going to happen. About ten feet from him on his
left was another soldier, standing upright and motionless
in the shadow of the stockade. Ten feet
beyond this soldier was another. These were all
that Bob could see, but he knew that there were
good men and true stationed at regular intervals all
along the stockade, waiting to act the several parts
that had been assigned to them.</p>

<p>Bob waited and listened for a quarter of an hour
or more, and then he heard a conversation carried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
on in a low tone on the other side of the stockade.
He could not catch the words, but he knew that
the deserters were beginning to bestir themselves,
and that one of their number was talking with the
sentry. Presently a scratching, scrambling sound,
accompanied by heavy, labored breathing and those
incoherent exclamations that men sometimes use
when they are exerting themselves to the utmost,
told Bob that somebody was making his way up
the logs. Keeping his eyes fastened on the top, he
saw a soldier climb up and seat himself on the
plate. He could see him very plainly against the
light background of the sky, and he recognized
him at once. It was Bristow. He was about to
swing himself off when he discovered Bob standing
beneath him. He stopped, peered down into
the darkness for a moment, and then called out
in a frightened whisper,</p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<p>"It's all right," whispered Bob in reply; "come
on."</p>

<p>"Who is it, I say?" repeated Bristow in still
more earnest tones.</p>

<p>"Why, don't you know Dodd? Hand me your
carbine."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" said Bristow with a great sigh of relief.
"It <i>is</i> all right, isn't it? Here you are."</p>

<p>Holding his carbine by the strap, Bristow passed
it down to Bob, who promptly slung it upon
his back. The latter then pushed up his sleeves,
moved back a little from the stockade, and when
Bristow swung himself down by his hands and
dropped lightly to the ground, Bob stepped up
and took him by the arm.</p>

<p>"I don't need any help," said Bristow, who
had landed squarely on his feet. "But I say,
Dodd&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll talk about it as we go along," interrupted
Bob. "But not a loud word out of you, unless you
want to be gagged."</p>

<p>"Why, good gracious, it's Owens!" gasped Bristow,
reeling back against the stockade. He did
not ask what Bob was doing there or why he had
seized him, for he knew without asking.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is Owens, and the men you saw ride
out of the gate with me this afternoon are with
me now. Here's one of them," added Bob as a
soldier named Loring stepped up and took his
place in readiness to catch the next deserter who
came over the stockade.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then the sentry on the inside placed his
mouth close to one of the cracks between the logs
and asked, in a cautious tone,</p>

<p>"How is it, Bristow? Is the coast clear?"</p>

<p>"All clear," replied Loring, speaking through
the same crack. "Tell the boys to hurry up;
we've no time to waste."</p>

<p>If Bob's captive had any idea of attempting to
escape or of alarming his companions by crying
out, he abandoned it very quickly when he saw
the soldiers that were stationed along the stockade.
There was a trooper for every deserter, and as fast
as the man at the head of the line caught one, another
moved up and took his place.</p>

<p>"This bangs me!" said Bristow, in great disgust.
"Now comes a court-martial of course, and Goodness
only knows what will come after that&mdash;the
guard-house and a heavy fine, or the military
prison at Fort Leavenworth.&mdash;I say, Owens, how
did the colonel find it out?"</p>

<p>"Do you suppose he tells his secrets to us privates?"
asked Bob in reply.</p>

<p>"We spoke to somebody who was not worthy of
the confidence we placed in him," continued Bristow.
"The thing never could have become known<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
unless one of our own number had proved treacherous.
But we can easily find out who he is. There
are just thirty of us, and if there are only twenty-nine
arrested, the missing man is the guilty one.
When I find out who he is, I shall take particular
pains to see that the next battle he gets into is his
last."</p>

<p>This threat was uttered in a very low tone of
voice, for Bristow and his captor had by this time
reached the place where the lieutenant had stationed
himself to receive his men when they came in with
their prisoners. Bob reported, "Your orders have
been obeyed, sir," and took his stand close behind
his officer.</p>

<p>"I counted only twenty-six," said Bristow when
the sergeant-major came up and announced the complete
success of the undertaking. "There must be
four traitors among us."</p>

<p>"Have you counted in the horse-guards?" asked
Bob. "There they are on the top of that
ridge."</p>

<p>No, Bristow had not counted them in, for he
did not know until that minute that they had
been arrested. He was very much astonished when
he learned that every one of his party had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
secured, and could not for the life of him imagine
how the colonel had found out about it; for that
he knew <i>all</i> about it was evident from the manner
in which the arrests had been effected.</p>

<p>Having sent one of his men back to order up
the horses, the lieutenant formed his captives in
line, threw a guard around them and marched them
into the fort. Halting them on the parade, he went
in to report to the colonel, and when he came out
again he put every one of them into the guard-house;
after which Bob and his companions went
to the quarters and tumbled into their bunks.</p>

<p>Great was the astonishment among the soldiers
the next morning when it became known that the
expedition, which they supposed had gone out
in search of the hostiles, had returned to the fort
and captured thirty armed men, and that the
work had been done so quietly that the sentry
at the gate never knew anything about it until
it was all over. Of course they were quite at
a loss to determine who it was that told the colonel
about it; and the general impression seemed
to be that if there were a traitor among the
deserters, he had allowed himself to be captured
with the others in order to avoid suspicion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the non-commissioned officers who had
attempted to desert was one of the corporals belonging
to Bob's troop, and the next morning Bob
was ordered to take his place and do duty as corporal
of the guard. He saw the prisoners served
with breakfast, and the numerous orders he had
to give opened the eyes of one of them, who began
to think he had made a discovery. And so
he had, but he could not prove it.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what's a fact, boys," said Bristow
as he walked to a remote corner of his prison with
a cup of coffee in one hand and some cracker and
bacon in the other: "I know whom we have to
thank for our arrest."</p>

<p>"Who is it?" asked a dozen voices at once.</p>

<p>"I'd like to send him my compliments in the
shape of a bullet from my carbine," said the corporal
whose place Bob was then filling. "Tell us
who he is, so that we can improve the first chance
to get even with him."</p>

<p>"There he is," said Bristow, shaking his piece
of cracker at Bob. "He has been trying to get
on the blind side of the officers for a long time,
as you all know, and he has accomplished his
object at last by going back on his comrades."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>The prisoners looked at Bob as if they expected
him to deny the accusation; but, to the disappointment
of some of them who really liked him, he
had nothing to say.</p>

<p>"Why don't you speak up and declare that
it isn't so?" demanded the corporal.</p>

<p>"Because he dare not," exclaimed Bristow. "He
couldn't without telling a lie, and, as he is a good
little boy, he wouldn't do that for the world."</p>

<p>"I don't believe he did it," said another of the
culprits. "He is not one of us, and how could he
have found it out? I believe that the traitor is
right here in the guard-house under arrest."</p>

<p>"I know he isn't," declared Bristow. "Bob
Owens is the only traitor there is, and you may
depend upon it. Now, let me tell you just what
is going to happen when the court-martial comes
off: it will be proved to the satisfaction of all of
you that Owens found out about our plans in some
way or other, and went straight to the colonel with
them. You will be disrated, Corporal Jim, and
Lieutenant Earle, in order to reward Bob for carrying
tales and to encourage him to carry more,
will give him your place. Why, he has just as
good as got the stripes on his arm now."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>Corporal Jim looked daggers at Bob, and declared
that if he was the one who had disclosed
their plot to the colonel, he was too mean for any
use, and ought to be drummed out of the fort.</p>

<p>"I promised that if I ever found out who the
informer was I would serve him worse than that,"
said Bristow in savage tones. "I shall keep my
promise, too, if I ever get the chance, for I am
one who never forgets an injury."</p>

<p>Bob Owens&mdash;who, as we know, was not wanting
in physical courage&mdash;was not at all alarmed by this
threat and a good many others like it to which he
listened during the fifteen minutes the prisoners
were occupied in eating their breakfast. He believed
that he was able to take care of No. 1; and
when the critical time came, as it did a few weeks
later, he proved to the satisfaction of everybody
that his confidence in himself was not misplaced.</p>

<p>The court-martial was not long delayed, and
the findings being approved by the proper authorities,
the sentences were promptly carried out.
The culprits were confined in the guard-house for
different periods of time, those who had been the
most active in inducing their comrades to desert
serving a longer sentence than their victims, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
fines were imposed upon all of them, Bristow's
being by far the heaviest, as he was proved to be
the ringleader. He and Gus Robbins&mdash;both of
whom had been almost constantly in trouble ever
since they arrived at the post&mdash;were given to understand
that if they were detected in another attempt
at desertion they could make up their minds
to see the inside of the military prison at Fort
Leavenworth. Bristow proved to be a first-class
prophet. During the progress of the trial it came
out that Bob Owens was the one who discovered the
plot, and that through him it was communicated
to the colonel. Corporal Jim was of course reduced
to the ranks, and Bob was promoted to fill
the vacancy.</p>

<p>During the next few weeks nothing of interest
happened at the fort. The deserters were released
as fast as the terms for which they were sentenced
expired, some of them penitent and fully resolved to
do better in future, while the others were more than
ever determined to escape from military control, in
spite of all the officers and guards that could be
placed around them. They carried out their determination,
too, at every opportunity, deserting in
parties numbering half a dozen or so, and they gen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>erally
succeeded in eluding pursuit. It was a singular
fact that when the pursuers were commanded
by commissioned officers they very often returned
without having accomplished anything, but when
they were commanded by sergeants or corporals they
were almost always successful. Luck was on the
side of the "non-coms," and the colonel finally
learned to put a great deal of confidence in them.
Bob Owens was particularly fortunate in this respect,
and that was the reason his superior sent for
him one morning after the officer of the day had
reported that seven men had deserted during the
previous night, taking their arms and a supply of
ammunition with them.</p>

<h3>A PERILOUS UNDERTAKING.</h3>


<p>"Corporal," said the commandant, taking
off his eye-glasses with a jerk, as he always
did when he was about to say something emphatic,
"there are the names of seven men who deserted last
night. I want you to take command of a squad and
follow them up and arrest them."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," replied Bob.</p>

<p>"I don't know which way they went, or anything
about it," continued the colonel. "That is something
you will have to find out for yourself. I <i>do</i>
know, however, that they went on foot, and that
they are armed and well supplied with ammunition.
I want you to capture them at all hazards&mdash;at all
hazards, I say," repeated the colonel, bringing his
open hand down upon the table with a ringing
slap. "If you come back without them you need
not offer any excuses, for I shall not listen to them.
Arrest anybody you catch outside the stockade<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
wearing a United States uniform, no matter who
he is. There have been no passes granted this
morning, and no one except the guards and the
officer of the day has any business outside. That's
all."</p>

<p>Bob saluted and hurried from the room. As
he passed through the hall he glanced at the list he
held in his hand, and saw that it was headed by the
names of Bristow and Gus Robbins.</p>

<p>"This is about the easiest job I have had yet,
and these fellows are just as good as captured
already," said he to himself. "I know right where
to look for them, and I wouldn't be in their shoes
for all the money the paymaster had in his safe the
last time he was here. They are booked for Leavenworth,
sure.&mdash;May I go out, Willis?" he asked
of the sentry at the gate; "I am acting under
orders."</p>

<p>"That's all right," was the reply; "the officer
of the day told me to pass you. You are going
after those deserters, I suppose? Well, now, look
here," added the sentry, after looking all around to
make sure that there was no officer in sight: "you
remember those mulewhackers who brought that
freight here the other day, don't you? Well, Bris<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>tow
and the rest have gone off to join them. I am
certain of it, for I heard Bristow talking with them,
and they assured him that the wagon-master would
give him steady work and good wages if he would
hire out to him. Bristow didn't hesitate to talk
with them about it in the presence of a dozen of
us."</p>

<p>"That was only a ruse on his part," said Bob
confidently. "If I followed the trail of those
teamsters I should have my trouble for my pains.
I am going as straight toward Brownsville as I
can go, and I shall have my hand on Mr. Bristow's
collar before I have gone thirty miles. You may
rest assured that I shall not come back without
him, for if I do I don't know what the colonel
will say to me."</p>

<p>Bob hastened toward the place where the horses
were picketed, and there he found the officer of the
day and the six picked men who had been detailed
to accompany him. It was the work of but a
few minutes to lead their horses into the fort and
put the saddles and bridles on them; and when this
had been done, and Bob and his men had secured
their carbines, sabres and revolvers and put two
days' rations in their haversacks, they mounted and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
rode through the gate at a sharp trot. They were
quiet and orderly enough as long as they remained
within sight of the fort, but when the first ridge
over which they passed shut them out from view
they abandoned their efforts to keep in column,
threw off all restraint and shouted and sang at
the top of their voices. They looked upon an
expedition like this as a "lark," and enjoyed it
as much as a schoolboy enjoys a picnic.</p>

<p>Bob did not stop at the first ranches he passed,
for he knew that the deserters (provided, of course,
that they had fled along that trail) must have gone
by them in the night, and that consequently their
inmates could give him no information. Besides,
Bob had learned by experience that there was very
little confidence to be placed in anything the ranchemen
might say regarding a deserter. A good many
of them had served in the army during the war,
and, knowing how very hard is the life a soldier
leads, they sympathized with him in his efforts to
escape, and aided him by every means in their
power. Where there was one farmer or stock-raiser
who would give a squad like Bob's any
information that could be relied on, there were a
dozen who would conceal the deserter in their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
houses and send his pursuers off on the wrong
trail.</p>

<p>After Bob and his troopers had ridden about
fifteen miles, and had shouted and sung off a little
of their surplus enthusiasm, they relapsed into
silence and settled down to business. They halted
on the top of every ridge to survey the country before
them, and called at every ranche that lay along
their route; but nothing was to be seen or heard of
Bristow and his party. About noon they came within
sight of a squatter's cabin, and Bob decided to
stop there and eat dinner. The owner of the cabin
was at home, and he welcomed the horsemen with
every appearance of cordiality.</p>

<p>"Alight an' hitch, strangers," said he, when he
had succeeded in quieting the small army of dogs
which came out from under the cabin to dispute
the further advance of the troopers. "You're as
welcome as the flowers in May."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Bob as he swung himself from
his saddle. "We intend to stop here and rest for
an hour or so. We'll boil our coffee and cook our
rations on your stove, if you have no objections."</p>

<p>"I ain't got no stove," replied the squatter hastily&mdash;"leastways,
none that you can do cookin' on,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
he added, with some confusion, when he saw Bob
and one or two of his men look up at the stovepipe
which projected above the roof.</p>

<p>"All right!" replied the corporal, silencing by
a look one of the troopers who was about to say
something. "Then we shall have to build a fire
outside; but that will do just as well, for we are
used to cooking our grub in that way.&mdash;Now,
Carey, if you and Loring will skirmish around
and find some wood and start the coffee-pot going,
we will look out for your nags."</p>

<p>"Corporal," whispered one of the troopers,
"there's a bug under that chip. In other words,
this old rascal has some reason for wishing to keep
us out of his cabin."</p>

<p>"Say nothing out loud," replied Bob with a
warning gesture. "We are on the right track,
and I know it. If we fail now, it will be through
our own blundering."</p>

<p>Having seen the horses staked out, Bob walked
back to the cabin, and found the squatter in conversation
with Carey and Loring. His first words
indicated that he had been trying to pump them,
but without success.</p>

<p>"Say, soldier, where might you be a-travellin'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
to?" he asked as Bob came up. "I asked them
two fellows, an' they told me I had better ask
you."</p>

<p>"We are looking for seven deserters who passed
this way some time this morning," answered Bob.
"They were on foot and carried carbines. Seen
anything of such a party?"</p>

<p>The squatter brought his hands together with a
loud slap before he replied.</p>

<p>"I jest knowed them fellows wasn't what they
allowed they was," said he. "In course I seed 'em,
an' they told me they was a-lookin' for deserters
themselves. They went off that way, toward the
old Brazos trail," added the squatter, pointing in
a direction which lay exactly at right angles with
the course Bob had been pursuing.</p>

<p>"Did they?" exclaimed the corporal with a great
show of eagerness. "Thank you for the information.
We will go that way too as soon as we
have eaten dinner. How long ago did they pass
this way?"</p>

<p>"Jest at daylight."</p>

<p>"That's another lie," said Bob to himself. "They
didn't desert until after midnight, and they couldn't
have travelled between fifteen and twenty miles in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
less than five hours on foot. An infantryman might
do it on a pinch, but a trooper couldn't."</p>

<p>"You'll have to hurry up if you want to ketch
'em," continued the squatter, who seemed to grow
nervous when he saw how deliberately the troopers
went about their preparations for dinner. "They
was a-lumberin' along right peart."</p>

<p>"Oh, there's no need that we should throw ourselves
into a perspiration," replied Bob indifferently.
"We don't care if we don't find them for
a week. You see, when we are out on an expedition
like this we are not obliged to drill, and our
pay goes on just the same. If you have anything
good to eat, trot it out; we're wealthy."</p>

<p>But the squatter protested that he had nothing in
his cabin except bacon and crackers, and his supply
of these necessary articles was so small that he
could not possibly spare any of it. He said so
much on this point that the troopers would have
been dull indeed if they had not suspected something.</p>

<p>"He wants to get us away from here, doesn't
he?" said Carey as soon as he had a chance to
speak to Bob. "He thinks that if he provides us
with a good dinner we will spend a long time in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
eating it. Now, corporal, I will bet you anything
you please that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," interrupted Bob, "and I want you to
take a look into the matter at once. This is my
plan."</p>

<p>Here Bob whispered some rapid instructions to
the trooper, who winked first one eye and then the
other to show that he understood them. Pulling
his pipe from his pocket, he proceeded to fill it
with tobacco, while Bob walked up to the squatter,
and, taking him confidentially by the arm, said,
as he led him out of earshot of the men, who had
seated themselves about the fire,</p>

<p>"May I have a word with you in private?
You see, I am an officer, and it won't do for me
to talk too freely in the presence of those I command."</p>

<p>So saying, Bob led the squatter behind the cabin
and began making some very particular inquiries
concerning Bristow and his party: What sort of
looking fellows were they? What did they say?
Did they get anything to eat at the cabin? and did
his friend the squatter really think they had gone
toward the old Brazos trail? The man was very
uneasy, and seemed impatient to go back to the fire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
again; but by holding fast to his arm, and plying
him with such questions as these, Bob managed to
keep him behind the cabin for about five minutes,
and that was long enough for Carey to carry out
the orders that had been given him.</p>

<p>As soon as Bob and the squatter disappeared
around the corner of the cabin, Carey put his pipe
into his mouth, and, enjoining silence upon his
comrades by shaking his fore finger at them, he
quickly mounted the steps that led to the porch
and walked into the cabin. As he did so there was
a faint rustling in one corner of the room, and, looking
over his left shoulder without turning his head,
Carey saw a man who was lying on a rude couch
draw a blanket quickly over his face. In his eagerness
to conceal his features the man probably forgot
that he had a pair of feet, for he pulled the
blanket up a little too high.</p>

<p>"Aha! my fine lad," said the trooper as he noiselessly
opened the stove-door and looked into it, as
if he were searching for a live coal with which to
light his pipe, "I see a pair of No. 12 army brogans,
and also the lower portions of a pair of light
blue breeches with a yellow stripe down the seams.
Bryant, my boy, that's you. I see also that this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
stove is in perfect order, but as there are no coals
in it, I'll have to get a light at the fire outside."</p>

<p>When Carey came out of the cabin his comrades'
faces were full of inquiry, but the trooper only
winked at them and nodded his head, as if to say
that he could tell something that would astonish
them if he only felt so disposed.</p>

<p>By this time dinner was ready, and Loring's
loud call of "Coffee!" brought Bob and the squatter
from behind the cabin. The latter accepted
Loring's invitation to drink a cup of coffee with
"the boys," but he disposed of it in great haste,
hot as it was, as if he hoped by his example to induce
them to do likewise. But Bob and his companions
were in no hurry. They lingered a long
time over their homely meal, and then the smokers
were allowed to empty a pipe apiece before the order
was given to "catch up." The squatter began
to breathe easier after that, and when he saw the
troopers in their saddles and ready to start, his delight
was so apparent that they all noticed it.</p>

<p>"Wa'l, good-bye, if you must go," said he cheerily.
"Will you stop when you come back?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't expect to see us here again,"
said Bob. "If we go to Brazos City, we shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
take a short cut across the country when we return
to the fort."</p>

<p>"That's where I reckon they're goin', as I told
you; an' my advice would be for you to go straight
to Brazos, without stoppin' on the way, an' when
they get there you'll be all ready to take 'em in.
See?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I see," answered Bob, "and it's something
worth thinking of.&mdash;Forward, column left!
Trot! gallop!"</p>

<p>The troopers moved rapidly away from the cabin,
and, to the intense surprise and indignation of all
his followers, who thought that their corporal had
been deceived by the squatter, Bob led them off
toward the old Brazos trail. At length one of them
ventured to remonstrate.</p>

<p>"Corporal," said he, "you're going wrong."</p>

<p>"I know it," answered Bob.&mdash;"Carey, tell us
what you saw in that cabin. Were our suspicions
correct?"</p>

<p>"Indeed they were," was Carey's reply. "In
the first place, that stove was all right, but the
squatter didn't want us to use it, for Bryant was
hiding in the cabin. He was lying on the floor,
covered up with a blanket."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>"How do you know it was Bryant?" asked Bob.
"Did you see his face?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't; it was concealed by the blanket.
I saw his feet," said Carey; and his answer was
received by the troopers with a sigh of satisfaction.
It was all that was needed to establish the
identity of the man who had taken refuge in the
squatter's cabin.</p>

<p>"I didn't think I could be wrong," observed
Bob, "for that man condemned himself before we
had been in his presence ten minutes."</p>

<p>"Why don't you go back and snatch Bryant?"
demanded one of the troopers, seeing that the
corporal did not slacken his pace. "Why didn't
you do it while we were at the cabin?"</p>

<p>"Because I had no right to do it," answered
Bob. "If I should go to searching houses, I
might get myself into trouble with the colonel.
Another thing, boys: I shouldn't care to enter
that man's castle to look for anything unless I
was a civil officer and armed with a search-warrant.
He is a hard one, unless his looks belie
him."</p>

<p>"I thought so myself," said Loring. "But
you are not going back without Bryant, are you?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
What do you suppose he is doing there, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Of course I shall not go back without him,"
answered Bob quietly. "He has probably hired
out to that squatter, and we must watch our chance
and catch him out of doors before we can arrest
him."</p>

<p>"Well, are you going to Brazos City?"</p>

<p>"Not by a long shot. Bristow and the fellows
who are still with him have not gone that way.
As soon as we get behind that belt of post-oaks
you see in advance of us, I intend to circle around
and go back toward the river again."</p>

<p>Although the troopers rode at a rapid gait, it
took them nearly three hours to carry out this
programme. At the end of that time they struck
the old stage-road, which, in the days gone by,
had served as a highway between Brownsville and
some of the remote frontier-towns; but when the
raiders forced the settlements back into the interior
the stage-route was abandoned, and all that now
remained to tell of the business that had once been
done on it were the half-ruined stations which were
scattered along the road at intervals of fifteen or
twenty miles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>These stations were built of stone, and were
large enough to accommodate a dozen horses and
half as many stable-men and drivers, besides the
necessary food for both men and animals. Each
station was provided with a "dug-out," a miniature
fort, into which the employees of the route
could retreat in case they were attacked by hostile
Indians or Mexican raiders. It was simply a
cellar of sufficient size to shelter nine or ten men
at close quarters, covered with logs and dirt, and
furnished with loopholes on all sides at the height
of a foot or more above the ground. It looked
like a mound of earth supported on logs about two
feet high. The only way of getting into one of these
little fortifications was through an underground passage-way
which led from the stables. With these
arrangements for their defence a few well-armed
and determined men could hold their own against
all the raiders that could get around them.</p>

<p>About four o'clock in the afternoon Bob and his
troopers came within sight of one of these stations,
and as soon as their eyes rested upon it they drew
up their horses with a jerk, at the same time uttering
exclamations of astonishment and delight.
Standing in front of the open door were several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
men dressed in the uniform of the regular army.
They seemed to be holding a consultation, and so
deeply engrossed were they with their deliberations
that they did not notice the approach of the troopers,
although the latter had stopped their horses
on the summit of a high ridge in plain view of
them.</p>

<p>"I wonder if those are our men?" said Carey,
with some excitement in his tones.</p>

<p>"We shall soon know," was Bob's calm reply.
"Whoever they are, they will have to give an
account of themselves, for I am instructed to arrest
everybody I meet wearing a uniform."</p>

<p>"If they <i>are</i> our fellows, we've got them corralled,"
remarked Loring.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I don't much like the way we have
'corralled' them," returned Carey. "Do you see
that dug-out about twenty yards from the northwest
corner of the station? If they go in there
they can laugh at us. The only way we could
get them out would be to starve them out."</p>

<p>"That would take too long," said Bob; and
the tone in which the words were uttered made
his comrades look at him with some curiosity.
"Let's go down there and interview them, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
then we shall know how to act. Forward!
Trot!"</p>

<p>Just as these commands were given a commotion
among the men in front of the station indicated that
somebody had sounded an alarm. They gazed at
the troopers for a moment as if they were thunderstruck,
and then made a simultaneous rush for the
entrance. This action on their part told Bob as
plainly as words that they were the men of whom
he had been sent in pursuit, and that they did not
intend to go back to the fort if they could help it.
A moment later a loud slamming and pounding
indicated that the deserters were trying to close
and barricade the door. This had scarcely been
accomplished when the troopers dashed up to
the station and swung themselves out of their
saddles.</p>

<p>Leaving two of his men to hold the horses, Bob
and the rest walked around the corner of the station
and looked at the dug-out. There was a face
in front of every loophole. Anybody could see
that the deserters had the advantage of position,
and the troopers wondered what Bob was going
to do about it. They glanced at his face, but could
see nothing there to tell them whether he was ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>cited,
afraid or discouraged. It wore its usual expression.</p>

<p>"Well, boys," said Bob at length, "if you have
grown tired of roaming about the country, come
out, and we will go back to the post. The colonel
wants to see you."</p>

<p>"We don't doubt it, but we don't want to see
him," replied a voice that Bob recognized at once.
"We think we see ourselves going back! We
didn't desert for that."</p>

<p>"Gus Robbins, I am sorry that you are in there,"
said Bob. "What will you say to your father and
mother when you see them again?"</p>

<p>"Don't know, I am sure," answered Gus.
"Haven't had any time to think about that. But
you know yourself that I can't go back to the
post. The colonel said that if I were ever court-marshaled
again for desertion, I should go to prison;
but I'll fight till I drop before I'll do
that."</p>

<p>"Say, Bob," shouted another voice, "do you
remember what I said I would do to that informer
if I ever found out who he was? You are
the fellow, and here's your pay."</p>

<p>It was Bristow who spoke, and as he uttered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
these words he thrust the muzzle of his carbine
through the loophole in front of him. The chorus
of ejaculations and remonstrances which arose from
the inside of the dug-out showed that the rest of
the deserters were not yet ready to resort to the
use of their firearms; but Bristow was almost
half crazed by rage and fear, and just as somebody
seized him from behind and jerked him
away from the loophole, his carbine roared, and
Bob Owens turned halfway round and staggered
back a step or two, as if he were struck and
about to fall.</p>

<p>This unexpected act excited Bob's troopers&mdash;with
whom he was an especial favorite&mdash;almost
to frenzy. Believing that he had been seriously
if not fatally injured&mdash;it did not seem possible that
anybody could miss a mark of the size of his body
at the distance of ten paces&mdash;one of them sprang
forward to support him, while the others discharged
their carbines at the loopholes in rapid succession.
Their volley was not entirely without effect,
for a loud yell of agony came from the inside of
the dug-out, bearing testimony to the fact that
one bullet at least had found a target somewhere
on the person of one of the deserters.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p091.jpg" alt="p091" title="Storming the Dug-Out."/></div>
<div class="figcenter"><span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Storming the Dug-Out.</span></span></div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>"Cease firing!" shouted Bob.</p>

<p>He gently released himself from the embrace of
the strong arms that had been thrown around him,
and looked down at the gaping rent Bristow's bullet
had made in the breast of his coat. The missile
had passed through his thick carbine-sling and
breast-belt, had cut into his coat, vest and shirt,
and ploughed a deep furrow through a well-filled
wallet which he carried in his inside pocket. Fortunately,
it was a glancing shot, but the force with
which it struck him was almost sufficient to knock
him off his feet.</p>

<p>"I'm not hurt at all," said he as his men crowded
about him, "but I shall have to put a patch on
my coat when I get back to the post.&mdash;I say, there,"
he shouted, addressing himself to the inmates of
the dug-out, "was there anybody hurt in there?
I thought I heard a yell."</p>

<p>"Yes, and you'll hear another yell if you don't
go away and let us alone," replied Bristow. "I'll
make a better shot the next time I pull on you."</p>

<p>"All right!" said Bob. "I'll give you a chance
in just about five minutes.&mdash;Loring," he added in
a lower tone, "you and Phillips stay here and hold
the horses, and the rest of you follow me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you going to storm them?" asked Loring.</p>

<p>"I am," was the decided reply. "It is the only
way I can get them out, for they'll not come of
their own free will."</p>

<p>"Then I sha'n't stay here and hold the horses;
that's flat," declared Loring.</p>

<p>"Neither will I," chimed in Phillips. "The
picket-pins will hold them as well as we can."</p>

<p>"All right!" replied Bob. "Stake them out,
and while you are doing it Carey and I will see
how we are going to get into the station."</p>

<p>The door to which Bob now turned his attention
did not prove to be a very serious obstacle. It
was made of heavy planks, and if it had been in
good condition it would have taken a good deal of
chopping with a sharp axe before one could have
forced his way through it; but the hinges had rusted
off, and the planks had shrunk to such a degree
that the bar which held the door in its place could
be seen and reached with a sabre. A few blows
with one of these weapons knocked this bar from
its place, and when that was done, the door, having
nothing to support it, fell back into the stable
with a loud crash. Bob entered, with Carey at his
heels, and, making his way to a small apartment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
which had once been used as a sleeping-room by the
stable-men and drivers, he found there a trap-door,
which he threw open, revealing a flight of rude steps
leading into the underground passage that communicated
with the dug-out. By this time the rest
of the troopers arrived on the scene. They looked
dubiously at the dark passage-way, and then they
looked at Bob.</p>

<p>"Do you really mean to go down there, Owens?"
asked Loring. "It's sure death."</p>

<p>"I believe so myself, but I am going all the
same," replied Bob, who was thoroughly aroused by
the attempt that had been made on his life. "If
we are not willing to face death at any moment, we
had no business to enlist. Must I go alone?"</p>

<p>"Not much," was the unanimous response. "If
you are bound to go, we are going too."</p>

<p>"Leave your sabres and carbines here," commanded
Bob. "They will only be in the way.
Draw revolvers, but don't shoot except in self-defence."</p>

<p>Bob knew as well as his men did that he was
about to enter upon a very perilous undertaking.
Bristow had shown that he was desperate enough
to shoot, and he had even threatened that if he got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
another chance at Bob he would make a better shot
than he did before. Some of the men who were with
him were known to be hard characters, and it was
very probable that they would back him up in the
resistance he seemed determined to make. But Bob,
having made up his mind as to the course he ought
pursue, never once faltered. He was a soldier, and
a soldier's first duty was to obey orders. He had
been commanded to find the deserters and arrest
them at all hazards; and, having obeyed the first
part of his instructions, he was resolved to carry
them out to the letter or perish in the attempt.</p>

<p>"Now I think we are all ready," said Bob, after
the sabres and carbines had been laid in the empty
bunks and the revolvers drawn and examined.
"Stick close to me, and remember that if we don't
take them they will kill us. Bristow, Sandy and
Talbot are the only men we have to fear, and if we
can only get the drop on them we are all right.
Come on."</p>

<p>Although Bob was the youngest soldier, he was
the calmest one of the seven troopers who descended
those steps. When he reached the bottom he
looked along the passage-way toward the dug-out,
which was dimly lighted by the sunbeams which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
streamed in through the loopholes on the western
side, and saw the deserters standing in line awaiting
his approach.</p>

<p>"Halt!" cried a voice. "Come a step nearer
and you are all dead men."</p>

<p>It was Bristow who spoke, and the words were
followed by the ominous click of the lock of his
carbine.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">TOP</a></span>
<h3>THE NEW SCOUT.</h3>


<p>"Halt!" cried Bristow again. It was so dark
in the passage-way that he could not see
the troopers, but the sound of their footsteps told
him that they were still advancing toward the dug-out.
"That's twice," he continued. "If I have
to halt you the third time, I'll send a bullet out
there."</p>

<p>"Bristow, you had better not try that," answered
Bob, without the least tremor in his voice. "You
have already done more than you will want to
stand punishment for. Besides, I have got you
covered, and if you move that carbine a hair's
breadth you are a gone deserter."</p>

<p>"And I've got the drop on you, Sandy," said
Carey, thrusting his cocked revolver over Bob's
shoulder, "so don't wink.&mdash;I say, corporal," he
added in a whisper, "I don't see Talbot anywhere."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Neither do I," answered Bob. "Keep your
eyes open, for he may be up to playing us some
trick."</p>

<p>Whether it was the cool determination exhibited
by Bob and his men, or the consciousness that they
were in the wrong that took all the fight out of
the deserters, we cannot tell; but they were cowed
by something, and when Corporal Owens and his
troopers filed into the dug-out, and the former
sternly commanded them to "throw up," every
carbine was dropped to the ground and five pairs
of hands were raised in the air.</p>

<p>"Where's the other?" demanded Bob. "There
ought to be six of you."</p>

<p>"Here I am," said a faint voice.</p>

<p>Bob looked in the direction from which the voice
came, and saw Talbot sitting in a dark corner, his
carbine lying by his side and both his hands raised
above his head. He wore a handkerchief around
his forehead, and, dim as the light was, Bob could
see that it was streaked with blood.</p>

<p>"Are you badly hurt?" he asked with some
anxiety.</p>

<p>"No, he isn't," exclaimed Bristow, before the
wounded man could speak. "A glancing ball cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
a little crease in his scalp, and he thinks he is
killed."</p>

<p>"I wish you had this little crease in your own
scalp," said Talbot, looking savagely at Bristow.
"If it hadn't been for you I never should have
been here."</p>

<p>"And if it hadn't been for <i>you</i>, and a few cowards
just like you, we never should have been captured,"
retorted Bristow. "We could have held
our own against a squad four times as big as the
one Owens has brought with him; but now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That'll do," interrupted Bob. "I am not going
to have any quarrelling here; and, Bristow,
there's a court-martial coming, and you had better
keep a quiet tongue in your head.&mdash;Carey, stand in
the mouth of that passage-way.&mdash;Phillips, pick up
the carbines, and the rest of you sound them."</p>

<p>These orders were promptly obeyed, and when
the "sounding" had been completed the deserters
had not even a pocket-knife left.</p>

<p>"Now, boys," continued Bob, "as you seem to
like these quarters so well, you can stay here to-night&mdash;all
except you, Talbot; you will come up
and have your wound examined. We didn't come
prepared to take care of injured men, but we will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
do the best we can for you.&mdash;We will get some
supper for you men, and when you feel so inclined
you can spread your blankets on the floor and go
to sleep.&mdash;Go on, Carey."</p>

<p>At a sign from Bob the troopers followed Carey,
who led the way along the passage; then Talbot
fell in, carrying his blanket over his shoulder, and
Bob brought up the rear. The trap-door was shut,
and Talbot was informed that the sleeping-room
was to be his prison for the night. His wound was
dressed with some cold coffee that Bob happened
to have in his canteen, and the deserter was assured
that there was no cause for apprehension. The
wound, which was scarcely an inch long, was only
skin-deep, but it bled profusely, and that was
probably the reason why Talbot was so badly
frightened. When two sentries had been posted&mdash;one
at the door of the stable to keep an eye on
Talbot, and the other at the dug-out to see that
the deserters who were confined there did not attempt
to work their way out during the night&mdash;Bob
ordered supper to be served at once. He had
performed a brave act, and now that the danger
was over he began to realize that he had passed
through something of an ordeal. He lifted his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
cap, and found that his forehead was covered with
great drops of perspiration.</p>

<p>"You have done well," said Carey, extending
his hand to Bob when the latter came out of the
sleeping-room. "I didn't know you had so much
pluck. I shall take particular pains to see that
the lieutenant hears of this day's work."</p>

<p>"He will tell you that I did nothing but my
duty," replied Bob, who was very glad to know
that his men were satisfied with his conduct.</p>

<p>"But it isn't everybody who is brave enough
to do his duty," said Carey as he touched a match
to the light-wood he had piled in the fireplace;
"and perhaps the lieutenant will say that you
ought to be a sergeant. That <i>was</i> Bryant back
there in that squatter's cabin, wasn't it? I looked
for him the minute we entered the dug-out."</p>

<p>"So did I," answered Bob, "and I saw at a
glance that he wasn't there. We will attend to
him to-morrow."</p>

<p>"But perhaps he won't be there."</p>

<p>"I think he will. It is my opinion that he
has hired out to that squatter, and that he intends
to trust to disguise to escape recognition. A man
in citizen's clothes doesn't look much like the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
man in uniform; did you ever notice that? But
even if he isn't there, what odds does it make to
us? We are having a good time, and I would
just as soon stay out here on the plains for a
week or ten days as to go back to the fort and
drill."</p>

<p>"I say, corporal," exclaimed the sentry who was
stationed at the door, "here's somebody coming,
and unless my eyes are going back on me he is
dressed in uniform."</p>

<p>"Who in the world can it be?" exclaimed
Carey.</p>

<p>"We'll soon find out," replied Bob, "for if he
has got any of our uncle's clothes on we are bound
to take him in, unless he proves to be an officer."</p>

<p>Bob and his men hurried to the door, and,
looking in the direction in which the sentry was
gazing, saw a horseman about a quarter of a
mile away. He had halted on the top of a ridge,
and Loring, who had good "Plains eyes," declared
that he was looking at them through a field-glass.
He certainly was dressed in uniform, and had with
him a small black mule which bore a good-sized
pack on its back.</p>

<p>"I can't make him out," said Bob, waving his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
hand in the air and beckoning the horseman to
approach. "He is a soldier, but what is he doing
with that pack-mule? It isn't Bryant, is it? If
it is, where did he get that mule and that field-glass?&mdash;Loring,
you and Phillips put the bridles
on your horses&mdash;never mind the saddles&mdash;and stand
by to give him a race if he tries to run away. Don't
mount until I give the word."</p>

<p>But the horseman had no intention of running
away. He replied to Bob's signal by waving his
hand over his head, and after putting away his
field-glass rode down the ridge and came toward
the station at a gallop. As he approached nearer
the troopers saw that he was a stranger, and a
very good-looking one, too. He was almost as
dark as an Indian, his hair was long enough to
reach to his shoulders, and the eyes that looked
out from under the peak of his fatigue-cap were
as black as midnight and as sharp as those of an
eagle. He rode a magnificent horse, and his seat
was easy and graceful. His only weapon&mdash;that is,
the only one that could be seen&mdash;was a heavy Winchester
rifle, which was slung at his back. If he
was a soldier, he was a very fancy one, for his
cavalry uniform, although in strict keeping with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the regulations, was made of the finest material;
he wore white gauntlet gloves on his hands; and
instead of the ungainly, ill-fitting army shoe he
wore fine boots, the heels of which were armed
with small silver spurs. The troopers thought
from his dress and carriage that he must be an
officer, and when he drew rein in front of the
station they stood at "attention" and saluted him.</p>

<p>"I don't deserve that honor, boys," said the
stranger with a laugh; "I am not a shoulder-strap."</p>

<p>"You are not?" exclaimed Bob, who was not a
little astonished as well as provoked at the mistake
he had made. "Well, it seems to me that you are
throwing on a good many frills for a private.
Where do you belong?"</p>

<p>"At Fort Lamoine," said the stranger; and the
answer was given in a tone quite as curt as was
that in which the question was asked.</p>

<p>"So do I, but I don't remember to have seen you
there, and so I shall have to ask you to give an account
of yourself. Dismount."</p>

<p>"I shall do as I please about that," replied the
stranger, who had all the while been staring very
hard at Bob.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you won't do as you please about it," returned
the corporal, while Carey walked up and
took the stranger's horse by the bit. "You will
do as <i>I</i> please. If you belong at Fort Lamoine
you will go there with me in the morning, and
then I shall be sure you get there. I am acting
under orders."</p>

<p>The horseman thrust his hand into the inside
pocket of his jacket, and pulling out a bill-book
took from it a paper which he opened and handed
to Bob to read.</p>

<p>"If you are acting under orders I have no more
to say," said he, "but there is something which
I think will see me through until day after to-morrow.
It is my furlough. Look here, partner,"
he added suddenly, "isn't your name Bob
Owens?"</p>

<p>The latter started as if he had been shot, his under
jaw dropped down, and for a few seconds he
stood looking at the speaker as if he could hardly
believe his ears. Then a light seemed to break
in upon him, and springing forward he grasped the
horseman by the arm and fairly pulled him out of
the saddle. After that he shook one of his hands
with both his own and executed a sort of war-dance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
around him, while the troopers stood and looked
on in speechless amazement.</p>

<p>"George Ackerman, I am delighted to see you
again," cried Bob as soon as he could speak. "I
take it all back, George: I didn't mean to insult
you."</p>

<p>"It's Owens, isn't it?" said George, for it was he.</p>

<p>"Of course it is; and if you hadn't been blind
you would have known it as soon as you saw me,"
replied Bob.</p>

<p>"I don't think my eyesight is any worse than
your own, for you didn't know me until I called
you by name," retorted George. "Your uniform
tells me where you have been and what you have
been doing since I last saw you, but it doesn't tell
me how I came to lose you in Galveston so suddenly
and mysteriously. If we had kept together a
little while longer we should have been all right,
for I had scarcely missed you before I ran against
Mr. Gilbert&mdash;the friend to whom I wrote for
money, you know. If you belong at Fort Lamoine,
what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Stake out your horse and mule and I will tell
you all about it," answered Bob. "But first tell
me what right you have to wear those clothes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am a United States scout," replied George.
"At least, that was the title under which I was
sworn in, but it does not clearly explain the duties
that are expected of me. I am to act as guide to
the troops when they cross the river in pursuit of
the raiders."</p>

<p>"Oh yes," exclaimed Bob; "I remember all
about it now. I was off after the hostiles when
you came to the post and offered your services to
the colonel. When I came back I found that the
men had a good deal to say about our new scout,
who, they said, looked about as much like a scout
as they looked like the queen of England; but I
had no idea who he was; and, seeing it's you, I'll
not arrest you," he added with a laugh.&mdash;"Great
C&aelig;sar! that was the second close call I have had
to-day."</p>

<p>"If I had had any idea that you were going to
touch him I should have warned you," said George.
"It won't do for a stranger to come within reach of
him, and it's the greatest wonder in the world that
he didn't knock your brains out."</p>

<p>While the two friends were talking, George Ackerman,
with the dexterity acquired by long experience,
relieved the mule of his heavy pack and slip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>ped
the halter over his head, leaving the animal at
liberty. Bob, judging the mule by those unruly
members of his species that were employed in the
quartermaster's department at the fort, stepped up
and attempted to lay hold of his foretop; but the animal
dodged him very cleverly, and, wheeling like
lightning, sent both his heels at the boy's head.
The latter dropped just in time to escape the blow,
but he felt the "wind" of the heels in his face and
heard them whistle close by his ear.</p>

<p>"Does he always act that way when strangers
approach him?" asked Bob as he picked up his cap.
"If he does, you need not be afraid that anybody
will steal him. I tried to catch him because I was
afraid he would run off."</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll not do that. I never think of staking
him out, for he always stays by my horse, and
I can catch him anywhere. There's a horse for
you, Bob, and the best one I ever owned. He is
a present from Mr. Gilbert, who bought him in
Kentucky for his own private use, but when he
found that I was going into the army he gave
him to me, with the assurance that Fletcher and
his band could never make a prisoner of me while
I was on his back. I lost my old horse, Ranger,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
at the time I was captured by the Greasers, and he
was killed at the battle of Quer&eacute;taro. Now, what
are you doing so far away from the fort?" asked
George as he picked up his picket-pin and led
the horse around the station to find a good place
to stake him out. "How did you come to go into
the army, anyway, and what have you been doing
to win those stripes?"</p>

<p>"It would take a long time to answer your last
two questions," answered Bob, "and so we will
leave them until the rest of the boys have gone
to bed. I came here in pursuit of seven men who
deserted last night."</p>

<p>"You did? Well, Bob, your superiors must
have a good deal of confidence in you to send you
off on such an expedition. Where do you expect
to find them?"</p>

<p>"I have found them already, and arrested them
too; that is, I have caught six of them, and I
know where the other one is. I intend to take
him in hand to-morrow, though, to tell the truth,
I don't know just how I am going to do it. I
could have arrested him to-day if I had had
authority to take him out of a house; but I
wasn't sure on that point, and so I let him go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
until I could have time to make up my mind to
something. I got <i>that</i> about fifteen minutes before
you came up," said Bob, directing his friend's attention
to the hole in his coat that had been made by
Bristow's bullet. "My men returned the fire and
slightly wounded one of the deserters, who is now
laid out on his blanket in the sleeping-room. By
the way, do you know Gus Robbins?"</p>

<p>"I should say I did," replied George, after he
had followed the course of the bullet through Bob's
clothing and expressed his surprise at his friend's
narrow escape. "He ran away from his home in
Foxboro', and came down here to visit my cousin,
who was at that time living with his father at my
ranche. He and Ned, who were constantly pluming
themselves on the numerous scrapes from which
they had narrowly escaped, could not rest easy until
they kicked up a row in the settlement, and they
did it by shooting Mr. Cook's cattle. The consequence
was, that I had to show them the way out
of the country. Don't you remember I told you
all about it on the morning we walked from that
trapper's cabin to White River Landing? I say,
Bob, have you any idea of becoming a trapper when
your term of service expires?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nary idea," was the emphatic reply. "A
soldier's life is hard enough for me, and there is
quite as much danger in it as I care to face."</p>

<p>"What do you know about Gus Robbins?"
continued George. "He left my cousin Ned very
suddenly in Brownsville, and none of us ever heard
of him afterward. It can't be possible that he enlisted
too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he did. He belongs to my troop, and is
just as fond of getting into scrapes as he ever was.
When he is not in the guard-house he is almost sure
to be doing extra duty for some offence against military
discipline. He was one of the deserters I was
ordered to capture, and he is in the dug-out now.
But I almost wish he had got away. You know
him, and when I was arresting him I almost felt
as if I were doing something against you. I
haven't forgotten that you offered me a home,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The obligation is all on my side," interrupted
George. "You saved my life twice. Let's sit
down here and talk a while. Go ahead and tell
me something."</p>

<p>The boys threw themselves on the grass near
the place where George had staked out his horse,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
and Bob began and described some of the interesting
incidents that had happened since he last
saw the cub pilot. He told the truth in regard
to everything, not even excepting the parting in
Galveston. His experience in the army was rapidly
working a change in him, and he had not
told a wilful lie since he assured the recruiting-officer
that he was an orphan and that there was
no one in the world who had a right to say whether
he should enlist or not.</p>

<p>"I have done a good many mean things in my
life, I am sorry to say," Bob added in winding up
his story, "but about the meanest trick I ever played
upon anybody I played upon you on the day
we parted. I found fifty cents in my watch-pocket,
which I had carelessly shoved in there when money
was plenty, and I knew it would buy me supper
and lodging. It wasn't enough for both of us,
so I ran away from you and went off by myself.
That's the way we became separated, and I tell
you of it at the risk of losing your friendship."</p>

<p>"You risk nothing at all," replied George,
extending his hand. "I couldn't expect that you
would take care of me and pay my way at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
sacrifice of all your own personal comfort; but
I do wish you had waited just a little longer,
for then you never would have had to enlist.
I am ready to prove that I think as much of you
now as I ever did. I shall keep an eye on you
until your term of service expires, and then you
must go home with me. I am sole master there
now&mdash;Mr. Gilbert is my guardian, but he never
has a word to say&mdash;and as you have no home of
your own&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That was a lie, George," interrupted Bob. "I
have a home at Rochdale, a few miles below Linwood,
where I first pulled you out of the river&mdash;you
know where it is&mdash;and as kind a father and
mother as any scoundrel of my size ever had.
When I ran away I intended to drop my identity
altogether, and that was the reason I told you
I was alone in the world. What do you think of
me <i>now</i>?"</p>

<p>George was greatly astonished at this confession,
for he had put implicit faith in Bob's story. He
was strictly truthful himself, and he could not
understand how a boy as physically brave as Bob
Owens had showed himself to be could be coward
enough to tell a lie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>"I feel sorry for you," said he at length; "and
if I were in your place I would go home as soon
as I received my discharge&mdash;if you keep on as
you have begun you may rest assured that it will
be an honorable one&mdash;and try to make amends
for my misdeeds. Remember that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'No star is ever lost we once have seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We always may be what we might have been,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and go resolutely to work to 'live it down.' You've
got the pluck to do it, I know."</p>

<p>"Coffee!" shouted Carey, thrusting his head
around the corner of the station.</p>

<p>"By the way," continued George as he and
Bob arose to their feet, "what did you mean by
saying that, seeing it was I, you wouldn't arrest
me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the colonel was mad when he started me
out this morning, and ordered me to gobble up
everybody&mdash;that is, privates and non-commissioned
officers&mdash;I caught outside the stockade. But
of course I couldn't touch you if I wanted to,
for your leave of absence protects you. You will
stay here to-night and ride to the fort with us
to-morrow, will you not?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly I will. Having found you again,
I am not going to leave you in a hurry. Say,
Bob, would you have any objections to bringing
Gus Robbins up to eat supper with us?"</p>

<p>"None whatever. I am sorry to be obliged to
keep him and the rest so closely confined, but I
know that they are a slippery lot&mdash;every one of
them has deserted before&mdash;and if I should let
them get away now that I have got a grip on
them, the colonel would give me Hail Columbia.
Gus has got himself into a mess, George. The
first time he deserted he was simply put into the
guard-house and fined, but this escapade is going
to land him at Leavenworth. Now I will make
you acquainted with our boys, and then I will
go down and tell Gus that you want to see
him."</p>

<p>After the new scout had been introduced to
the troopers, Bob raised the trap-door and descended
into the dug-out, while George opened his
pack-saddle and took out of it a tin cup and
plate, a can of condensed milk, a box or two of
sardines and a few other delicacies, which he laid
upon the table beside the simple fare that Carey
had just served up. By the time he had finished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the work of opening the cans with the aid of a
formidable-looking hunting-knife which he drew
from his boot-leg, Bob returned, followed by a
soldier who looked so unlike the dashing, fashionably-dressed
Gus Robbins he had seen in company
with his cousin Ned that George could hardly
bring himself to believe that he was the same
boy. He looked pale and haggard; and that was
not to be wondered at, for the prison at Fort Leavenworth
was constantly looming up before him.</p>

<p>George, as we know, had a very slight acquaintance
with Gus Robbins, having passed only
a few hours in his company, and he was under
no obligations whatever to interest himself in his
behalf; but when he saw how utterly miserable
he was, his heart bled for him, and he at once
hit upon a plan for getting him out of the trouble
he had brought upon himself. He greeted Gus
very cordially, gave him a seat beside himself
at the table, and tried to put a little life into him
by talking about almost everything except life in
the army.</p>

<p>The deserters must have thought that their captors
felt very much elated over their success, for
a noisier party than that which was gathered about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
that rough board table was never seen anywhere.
Being almost entirely free from military restraint&mdash;sergeants
and corporals do not hold their men
with so tight a rein as the commissioned officers
do, although they exact just as prompt obedience
to their commands&mdash;they told stories and said
witty things and sung songs until they were
hoarse. The additions to their larder which
George had been able to supply gave them a
better supper than they were accustomed to, and
they were merry over it.</p>

<p>None of the members of Bob's squad had ever
seen the new scout before, and, although they treated
him with the greatest respect, they were sadly
disappointed in him. The scouts with whom they
were familiar were great, rough, bearded men,
strong of limb and slovenly in dress, who had
lived among the Indians all their lives, and had
the reputation of being able to whip their weight
in wild-cats; but this one looked as though he
had but just come out of a fashionable tailor's
shop, and, moreover, he was nothing but a boy
in years. What could the colonel have been
thinking of when he engaged this stripling to
lead men across the river and into the midst of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
the desperadoes who were known to have their
strongholds there? It was dangerous work, and
the guide ought to be a person of courage and
experience; and George didn't look as though he
had either. That was what the troopers thought
as they sat at the table casting furtive glances at
the new scout, who was talking earnestly with
Gus Robbins; but it was not long before they
found out that it took a brave man to follow
where he dared lead.</p>

<p>The first trooper who finished his supper took
the place of the sentry at the door, and the next
relieved the one who was standing guard over
the dug-out. When these two had satisfied their
appetites the dishes were washed, the table was
laid again and the deserters were ordered up.
Some of them appeared to be very much disheartened,
and would scarcely look their comrades in
the face, while the others were so defiant, and
had so much to say about the colonel who had
ordered their arrest and the men who had carried
those orders into execution, that Bob was obliged
to warn them that if they did not eat more and
jaw less he would put them back into the dug-out
without any supper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>When the deserters had had all they wanted
to eat they were sent down to their prison, the
outside sentry was relieved, and Bob stood guard
at the door, with George for company. They
had much to talk about, and it was long after
midnight when they went to bed. They slept
on the same blankets, and the new scout went
off into the land of dreams with his arm thrown
lovingly around the boy who had twice saved
his life, and whom he had never expected to see
again.</p>

<h3>AN UNEXPECTED GUEST.</h3>


<p>"Well, old fellow, what do you think of
me now?"</p>

<p>It was George Ackerman who uttered these
words, and the question was addressed to his
herdsman, Zeke. The former stood in front of
a full-length mirror that hung against the wall
(among other extravagant and useless things for
which Uncle John had spent his nephew's money
were two elegant pier-glasses, one for his own
room and the other for Ned's), and Zeke was
sitting on the edge of a chair, with his elbows
resting on his knees and his chin supported by
his hands.</p>

<p>When the commander of Fort Lamoine accepted
his proffered services, George had asked for and
received a furlough for thirty days to enable him
to procure an outfit and to consult with his guardian
in regard to the management of the ranche<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
during his absence. That furlough had nearly
expired, and George was about to start for the
fort. The honest fellows who had so long been
employed on the ranche that they began to look
upon themselves as members of the Ackerman
family could not bear the thought of parting
from him, and Zeke especially felt very gloomy
over it. He had often denounced, in the strongest
terms, the circumstances which seemed to render
it necessary that his young friend should cast
his lot among the soldiers for a season, and on
this particular morning he looked as though he
had lost everything that was worth living for.</p>

<p>George had just put on his new uniform for
the first time, and no one, except a very intimate
acquaintance, would have recognized in him the
rough-looking cowboy whom we introduced to
the reader in the first volume of this series of
books. During the eighteen months he had lived
in the pilot-house he had fallen in with some of
the ways of those by whom he was surrounded,
and grown very particular in regard to his personal
appearance, although he did not by any
means go to extremes, as his cousin Ned had done.
As he placed the jaunty fatigue-cap over his long,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
curly hair he looked rather complacently at the
handsome face and figure that were reflected from
the polished surface of the mirror.</p>

<p>"Come, Zeke, don't be cross," said he, walking
up to his herdsman and giving him a slap on the
back. "Say just one kind word to me before I
go."</p>

<p>"I won't," growled Zeke in reply.</p>

<p>"Then wish me good luck in my new calling,"
added George.</p>

<p>"I won't," repeated the herdsman in a still louder
tone. "You're always going off on some new
callin' or another, an' I don't see no sort of sense
in it. Didn't I stay home here, quiet an' peaceable,
takin' care of your critters, while you was a-philanderin'
up and down the river on boats that was
likely at any minute to burn up or bust their
boilers? Now that you have got safe home again,
why in creation don't you stay here? Good land
o' Goshen!" shouted Zeke, jumping up, spreading
out his feet and flourishing both his huge fists in
the air, "of all the fool notions that ever a livin'
boy got into his head&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That'll do, Zeke," interrupted George with a
laugh. "I have heard that a thousand times, more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
or less, already. You will bid me good-bye when
I get ready to go, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I s'pose I won't do nothin' of the kind," exclaimed
Zeke. "Of all the fool notions that ever
a livin' boy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand. Come here and pack my clothes-bag
for me; you can do it better than I can."</p>

<p>"I won't. Them things is goin' to hang you
higher'n the moon the first you know," said Zeke,
scowling savagely at the elegant Mexican costume
which George lifted from the bed. "Don't you
never go 'crost the river with them duds on, 'cause
if you do Fletcher'll string you up for a spy."</p>

<p>"Not in peace-times, I guess," answered George.</p>

<p>"What odds does it make to sich as him whether
it's peace-times or not? You'll see."</p>

<p>"Well, he will have to catch me before he hangs
me. Go and tell the cook that I am getting tired
of waiting for breakfast."</p>

<p>"I won't; I won't never do nothin' for you no
more, nor say another word to you, nuther."</p>

<p>"I am sorry you feel so bad about it," said
George as he proceeded to pack his clothes away
in a canvas bag he had provided for that purpose;
"but the thing is done, and it can't be undone."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't care if the Greasers come over here
next full moon an' steal every huf an' horn you've
got," exclaimed the angry herdsman.</p>

<p>"I do," replied George; "I don't want them to
do anything of the kind. I don't want them to
steal another steer from me or anybody else, and
that is the very reason I became a scout. Our
troops are going to teach those fellows to stay on
their own side of the river, and I am going to help
them do it."</p>

<p>"There's enough without you," growled Zeke.</p>

<p>"Suppose that everybody thought so; where
would we get the men to fight our battles?&mdash;What
in the world is that?"</p>

<p>For just then there was a terrific uproar on the
porch. Above the stamping of heavy boots and
hoarse but subdued ejaculations of rage, such as
men sometimes utter when they are engaged in a
fierce struggle, arose the voice of one who spoke
in pleading accents, but whose words suddenly
ceased with a kind of gasping sound, as if his
throat had been seized by a strong hand. Zeke sat
up on his chair and looked at George, whose face
expressed the utmost bewilderment. Before either
of them could speak the door was thrown open with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
great violence, and a dishevelled and half-strangled
man, dressed in a dingy blue jacket and a pair
of dirty leather trousers, was pitched into the room,
with such force that when he brought up against
Zeke that worthy herdsman was knocked out of his
chair, and the two came to the floor together.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by such work as this?"
demanded George, looking first at the prostrate
man and then toward the door, where stood Jake
and Bob with their hands clenched and their faces
flushed with anger.</p>

<p>"Jest take a good squint at that feller's figger-head
an' answer the question for yourself, Mr.
George," answered Jake, shaking his fist at the man
who had been so unceremoniously introduced into
the room.&mdash;"Give it to him good an' strong, Zeke!&mdash;Well!
I'll&mdash;be&mdash;blessed!&mdash;Won't you, Bob?"</p>

<p>This exclamation was called forth by an action on
the part of George Ackerman that astonished Jake
and Bob beyond measure. Zeke had instantly recognized
the man who had so unexpectedly prostrated
him, and, seizing him by the back of the neck in
his iron grasp, began shaking him as a dog would
shake a rat. George also recognized the man after
he had taken a second look at him, and springing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
forward he seized Zeke's arm and tore his grasp
loose. Then he assisted the man to his feet, and
taking his hand in his own shook it cordially.</p>

<p>"Well, I <i>will</i> be blessed!" repeated Jake, who
stood looking the very picture of astonishment.&mdash;"Won't
you, Bob?"</p>

<p>"I should say I would," replied the latter, who
was equally amazed. "That's something <i>I</i> never
expected to see&mdash;an Ackerman shaking hands with
a cattle-thief!"</p>

<p>"Springer," exclaimed George, "I am glad to
see you again; and without your crutches, too!
I hope you have entirely recovered."</p>

<p>Yes, the man who had made his entrance into
George's room in so unusual a manner was Springer,
whom we have often spoken of as the wounded
cattle-thief. He had, as we know, once been in
the employ of George's father; but proving to be
utterly unfit for the position he held, Mr. Ackerman
had discharged him, and Springer had sought
revenge by making an unsuccessful effort to burn
the ranche. Of course he could not stay in Texas
after that, so he fled across the river and joined his
fortunes with the Contra-Guerrillas, a regiment of
desperadoes in the employ of the ill-starred Max<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>imilian.
He belonged, with other renegade Americans,
to Fletcher's band, who were the principal
foragers for Maximilian's army; but instead of
robbing the adherents of Juarez, who probably
had no stock worth stealing, they made numerous
raids across the river and ran off the cattle belonging
to the Texans. Springer was one of the band
who stampeded George's herd at Catfish Falls, and
during the short skirmish that followed Zeke sent
a bullet through each of his legs, wounding him
severely. He managed to keep up with the band
a few miles, but the rapid motion was too much
for him, and he was finally abandoned by his companions,
who hurried the captured cattle toward the
river, leaving Springer to look out for himself.</p>

<p>The pain occasioned by the wounds that had
been inflicted upon him by Zeke's Winchester was
so intense that the raider was forced to travel very
slowly. Arriving on the banks of a little stream
that ran across the trail he was pursuing, he rolled
out of his saddle to quench his thirst, which had
became almost unbearable; but his bridle slipping
from his hand, his horse wandered away, and, as
Springer was not able to walk, he could not catch
him again. He sank helplessly down beside a tree,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
where he was presently discovered by George Ackerman,
who was making his way on foot toward Mr.
Gilbert's ranche. The boy ministered to his wants
by bringing him water in his hat and sharing with
him his slender stock of provisions, and Springer
showed his gratitude by warning George of a plot
which his uncle John and cousin Ned had laid
against him. He went into all the details, but
George refused to believe a word of it until subsequent
events, which we have already described,
proved to his entire satisfaction that the thief had
told him nothing but the truth.</p>

<p>After spending half an hour in the man's company,
George caught his horse, assisted him into
the saddle, and Springer succeeded in crossing into
Mexico without being discovered by any of the
settlers whom Zeke had gathered together to recapture
George's herd. He made his way to Don
Miguel's ranche, and there our hero found him
when he was captured by Fletcher's men. The
raider seemed to be sorry for his misdeeds, and
George had assured him that if he ever made up
his mind to turn over a new leaf and lead a different
sort of life, he would assist him by every
means in his power.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Springer," said George, drawing up an easy-chair
for the use of his guest, "what brought you
over on this side of the river? Have you abandoned
Fletcher for good?"</p>

<p>The cattle-thief gasped and coughed three or
four times, as if he were trying to clear his throat
of something that stuck there and choked his utterance,
and finally nodded his head in reply.</p>

<p>"Don't pay no attention to him, Mr. George!"
exclaimed Bob. "He don't know nothin' but
stealin' an' lyin', that feller don't, an' I wouldn't
trust him as far as I could sling a yearlin'."</p>

<p>"If it wasn't for sich fellers as him you could
stay to hum quiet an' peaceable like, an' not have
to go off fur a soldier," added Jake.</p>

<p>"When I was a prisoner among the Greasers
he gave me advice that assisted me in making
my escape, and why should I not treat him kindly?"
demanded George, turning indignantly upon
the speakers. "No visitor at the Ackerman ranche
was ever treated so shamefully before, and I tell
you I don't want the thing repeated."</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. George," stammered Jake, "he rid
up to the porch an' said he wanted to speak to
you, an' so we brung him in&mdash;me an' Bob did."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go and tell the cook to put another plate on
the table and to hurry up breakfast," said George
with an air of disgust.</p>

<p>"Mr. George," said Zeke solemnly, "do you
mean by that that you're goin' to break bread
with this&mdash;this varmint?"</p>

<p>"I mean that Springer is going to eat a good
breakfast with me, if that is what you want to
know," replied George.</p>

<p>"Then, Bob, you needn't say nothin' about
that there other plate," continued the herdsman,
picking up his hat and moving toward the door.
"Springer can have the one I was goin' to use."</p>

<p>"Zeke, sit down and behave yourself," exclaimed
George.</p>

<p>"No, I won't. I ain't agoin' to eat salt with
a man what tried to burn this ranche over your
dead father's head, an' you a little babby at the
time, without no power to help yourself. I don't
know what this family is comin' to, anyhow."</p>

<p>"No more do I," chimed in Bob, while he and
Jake looked daggers at their employer's new guest.
"Things ain't as they used to be in the good
ole days. I won't wait on no table that he sets
at."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>As if moved by a common impulse, the three
men left the room, Zeke closing the door behind
him with no gentle hand. The cattle-thief seemed
to be greatly relieved to see them go, but their
extraordinary conduct made him very uneasy, and
he looked toward George to see what the latter
thought about it.</p>

<p>"Never mind them," said the boy encouragingly.
"They were employed on this ranche before
I was born, and have finally come to think that
they have more rights here than I have. Now,
what did you want to see me for? How can
I help you? If I were going to stay at home,
so that I could stand between you and the settlers,
I would give you a herdsman's berth, if
that is what you want; but I am going to Fort
Lamoine as soon as I have packed my things and
disposed of my breakfast, and I may not be back
for a year. I am a United States scout."</p>

<p>"I wondered what you were doin' with them
soldier-clothes on; an' that explains it," said
Springer, speaking with difficulty. "I don't reckon
you can help me none jest now, but mebbe I
can help you by puttin' you on your guard agin'
Fletcher."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is he after me again?" cried George. "I was
in hope I had seen and heard the last of him."</p>

<p>"Them kind of fellers is always turnin' up when
they isn't wanted," replied Springer. "He's come
back to his ole hole at that there ranche, bringin'
a good many of his ole men with him, an' some
new ones that would be wusser than he is, only
that ain't possible. Amongst them all, they have
laid a plan to visit you next full moon."</p>

<p>"Let them come," said George, snapping his
fingers in the air; "they'll not get me, or any
stock either."</p>

<p>"He wants you more'n he wants stock," continued
Springer. "That is, he wants you first.
Your uncle John put the very mischief into that
there feller's head, an' he's goin' to make a pris'ner
of you, like he did afore. He knows that you
are master here now&mdash;that you've got more money
an' cattle than you know what to do with; an' he
thinks you would rather give 'em all up than lose
your liberty."</p>

<p>"No doubt I would," answered George, "but
before he can make any demands upon me he
must catch me. That he will never do, for the
next time&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>He was about to say that the next time he saw
Don Miguel's ranche he would be so strongly backed
up that he would stand in no fear of the boss
cattle-thief and his band. But he didn't say it,
for he did not know how far it would be safe to
trust his friend Springer. He need not have been
so particular on this point, however, for the cattle-thief
knew as much about the contemplated movements
of General Ord's forces as George did himself.
The Mexican authorities had been notified
that if the raids from their side of the river were
not stopped our troops would take the matter in
hand and punish the thieves wherever they could
be found; and those same authorities had been
accommodating enough to warn Fletcher, and so
put him on his guard.</p>

<p>"Where have you been since I last saw you?"
inquired George, "and what has become of my
horse? What did the 'boss' say when he found
I had slipped through his fingers? I told you
I shouldn't stay there and allow myself to be
robbed. Did he follow me?"</p>

<p>"No, he didn't foller you, 'cause nobody knowed
till mornin' come that you had skipped out," answered
Springer. "When Fletcher went to call<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
you to breakfast, an' you wasn't there, he thought
you was a-loafin' around somewheres about the
ranche; but when somebody told him that the
hoss with the four white feet, that follered us
acrost the river on the night we tried to get the
strong-box out of this house, was gone, he knowed
in a minute what was up, an' he was about the
maddest man you ever see. But he couldn't take
time to hunt you up, an' all he could do was to
swear that he'd hold fast to you the next time he
got his hands on to you."</p>

<p>"He'll never get his hands on me again," said
George confidently.</p>

<p>"I hope he won't, but if he does it'll be worse
for you. That there black hoss of your'n is dead,"
continued Springer; "he was shot at Quer&eacute;taro.
You see, when we got down to the place where the
fightin' was goin' on, we knowed in a minute that
Max couldn't hold out much longer, so we started
one dark night to cross over to Juarez. His soldiers
seen us comin', an', thinkin' that we were
up to some trick or another, they turned loose on
us an' cut us up fearful."</p>

<p>"It served you just right," said George, with
honest indignation. "You had no business to go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
in with Maximilian in the first place, but having
joined him you ought to have stood by him to
the last."</p>

<p>"We <i>did</i> stand by him after that, 'cause we had
to," answered Springer. "But it didn't take 'em
long to captur' the place, an' it didn't take them
long either to say what should be done with Max.
He an' Mejia an' Miramon were took out on a hill
near the ruins of an old stone fort an' shot. I
didn't see it, 'cause I was under guard with Fletcher
an' the rest; but I heared some of 'em who did
see it say that just before the shooting was done
Max he says to Miramon, 'The bravest man should
have the post of honor;' so he puts Miramon in
the middle, an' Max he stood on the left. It was
a mean piece of business all the way through," said
Springer, drawing his hand nervously across his
forehead, "an' I am powerful glad that I am well
out of it. Now, Mr. George, seein' as how you
belong to the army, mebbe I had oughter tell you
something. You remember them two Greasers
who shot that cowboy down to Rio Grande City,
an' was put in jail for it, don't you? Well, they
belong to our gang, an' Fletcher an' the rest are
getting ready to go down there an' take 'em out."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well. Go right down to the commanding
officer at Eagle Pass and tell him of it," said
George promptly. "Then come up to Fort Lamoine,
and we'll see if the colonel won't do something
for Fletcher when he comes over here to capture
me."</p>

<p>"An' there's another thing I had oughter tell
you, Mr. George," continued Springer, sinking his
voice almost to a whisper. "I come over here as
a sort of spy, like. I am to find out all I can about
your ways&mdash;where you go of nights, an' all that,
you know&mdash;an' then I am to go down to Rio City,
take a look about the jail, see how many guards
there are, an' everything else that is worth knowin',
an' after that I am to go back an' tell Fletcher."</p>

<p>"I am glad you didn't say so while my men
were in here," observed George.</p>

<p>"I was just a trifle too sharp for that," said
Springer, shaking his head and looking very wise.
"I don't want to make them any madder at me
than they be now."</p>

<p>"But you are not going back to Fletcher with
any news, are you? You told me you had left him
for good."</p>

<p>"Mr. George," said Springer earnestly, "I ain't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
agoin' to take no news acrost the river that will do
anybody there any good. I ain't forgot that you
helped me when I was a-starving for grub an' water,
and I ain't likely to forget it, nuther. I did
say I had quit them fellers for good, an' when I
said it I meant it; but you can see by the way
your own men used me, right here under your
nose, that I couldn't stay here without nobody to
back me up. I can't starve, so I'll have to go
back till you come home again."</p>

<p>"If you will stay on this side of the river I will
see that you don't starve," replied George. "After
you have told the commanding officer at Eagle
Pass of the attempt that is to be made to release
those murderers, come up to Fort Lamoine and I
will find some honest work for you to do. The
soldiers at the post are not acquainted with you,
and consequently there will be no one to trouble
you. I will say that you used to work for my
father, and that will help you to a position."</p>

<p>While Springer was trying to make the boy understand
how grateful he was to him for his kindness,
there was a rap at the door, and Bob thrust
his head into the room to announce in a surly tone
that breakfast was ready.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where's Zeke?" asked George.</p>

<p>"Gone," was the laconic reply.</p>

<p>"All right! If he is foolish enough to go off
without any breakfast, let him go. He'll meet me
somewhere along the trail and say good-bye, I
know. Bob," added George, pointing to the clothes-bag,
which he had packed while he and his visitor
were conversing, "put this into the pack-saddle,
and have everything ready, so that I can start
as soon as I have eaten breakfast.&mdash;Come on,
Springer."</p>

<p>George led the way into an adjoining room, and
found an excellent breakfast waiting for him. The
cook, knowing that this was the last meal the young
master of the ranche would eat at that table for long
months to come, had exhausted all his knowledge
of the cuisine in the effort to serve up a breakfast
that would tempt George to eat, no matter whether
he was hungry or not.</p>

<p>True to his promise, Bob kept out of the breakfast-room,
and George and his guest were obliged
to wait on themselves; but as they were used to
that, they got on very well. While they were eating
George once more repeated the instructions he
had given Springer, and reiterated his promise to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
furnish him with steady employment and give him
a chance to make an honest living.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, George accompanied his guest to
the door, and saw him ride away toward Eagle Pass.
As soon as he was out of sight the boy went into
the house after his weapons and to take leave of
the servants, who were good-natured enough now
that Springer was gone. After shaking them all
by the hand, and listening to their hearty wishes
for his safe and speedy return, he mounted his
horse, which stood at the porch saddled and bridled,
took his pack-mule by the halter and rode
away toward Mr. Gilbert's ranche. The first person
to greet him as he drew rein in front of the
door was Zeke, who had so emphatically declared
that he would not have another word to say to
him.</p>

<p>"Where's that pizen varmint?" demanded the
herdsman in no very amiable tones.</p>

<p>"Look here, Zeke," replied George, "if you
should happen to meet that man while I am
gone, I want you to treat him civilly; do you
understand? If you see him in trouble, I want
you to help him out. He is sorry for what he
has done, and intends to lead a better life; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
if you don't assist him in every way you can,
you are not the fellow I take you for."</p>

<p>"Humph!" exclaimed Zeke contemptuously.
"Sorry, ain't he? Wants to lead a better life,
don't he? Well, it's mighty little chance he'll
have if he makes a business of bumpin' up agin
me the way he did this mornin', I bet you."</p>

<p>"He couldn't help it; Jake and Bob threw him
against you. I know he is in earnest, for he has
proved it. He came to the ranch to tell me that
my old friend Fletcher is coming over to capture
me next full moon, and he has now gone down
to warn the officer in command at Eagle Pass that
an attempt will soon be made to liberate the
murderers who are in jail there.&mdash;Good-morning,
Mr. Gilbert. I have stopped to say good-bye."</p>

<p>"Why don't you slap your foot down an' tell
him he sha'n't go, Gilbert?" demanded Zeke.</p>

<p>"I am as sorry to have him go as you are,"
replied Mr. Gilbert. "But it is to our interest
to do all we can to break up this raiding business,
and George can do more than any of us. In fact,
he is the only one in the settlement who can do
anything, for you know the colonel wouldn't accept
the services of our company of Rangers when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
we offered them to him.&mdash;Come in, George, and
say good-bye to Mrs. Gilbert and the girls."</p>

<p>This was soon done, for the boy did not like
to linger over the parting; but still, it was much
harder for him to take leave of these good friends
than he thought it would be. The whole family
accompanied him to the door, and when he came
out Zeke turned his back to him.</p>

<p>"Say good-bye to me," said George, giving
him a pat on the shoulder; "it's your last
chance."</p>

<p>"I don't care if it is," shouted the old fellow;
"I won't do it."</p>

<p>"Then I will say it to you: Good-bye, Zeke.
It will be a long time before I see you again, if
indeed I ever do, but I never shall forget you.
You have been a good friend to me."</p>

<p>This was altogether too much for the honest
herdsman. He faced quickly about, and, seizing
George's hand with a grip that brought tears to
his eyes, churned it up and down like a pump-handle.
Then he dropped it and turned away,
while George, without saying another word, vaulted
into his saddle and rode off. Zeke watched him
as long as he remained in sight, and then in bro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>ken
accents addressed the silent group who stood in
the doorway:</p>

<p>"Thar's that there boy."&mdash;here he waved his
hand in the direction in which George had disappeared&mdash;"he
was all I had, an' now he's gone off
to fight them Greasers without askin' me would
I let him go. I toted him in them there arms
when he was a yellin' babby not knee-high to a
duck; I put him on the fust hoss he ever rid;
I slept under the same blanket an' herded cattle
with him when he got bigger; I larnt him how
to throw the lasso an' shoot the rifle; an' now
he's went off an' left me alone! Dog-gone them
pizen Greasers!" roared Zeke, flourishing both
his fists in the air.</p>

<p>He lingered a moment, looking rather sharply at
Mr. Gilbert, as if he had half a mind to take him
to task for giving his consent to George's "fool
notion," and then, thinking better of it, he lumbered
down the steps, mounted his horse and galloped
off toward the place where he had left his
herd in charge of an assistant.</p>

<p>George camped two nights on the prairie, and on
the third afternoon, an hour or two before sunset, he
arrived within sight of one of the stage-company's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
deserted stables. Or, rather, it <i>was</i> deserted the
last time he saw it, but now there was an armed
soldier in front of the door, and he was presently
joined by others, one of whom, by signs, invited
him to approach. George complied, and presently
found himself surrounded by a squad of troopers
under the command of Corporal Bob Owens, who
greeted him as we have described.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">TOP</a></span>
<h3>HOW BRYANT WAS CAPTURED.</h3>


<p>Reveille was sounded the next morning by
Corporal Owens, who, having no drum or
bugle at his command, sprang up at daylight and
aroused his slumbering companions by shouting out
the order, "Catch up!" More from the force of
habit than anything else, he called the roll while
he was bundling up the blankets on which he and
George had slept, and, making the sergeant's salute
to an imaginary officer, he announced: "All present
or accounted for." Then Carey was ordered to
boil the coffee, and Bob and the three troopers who
were off duty went out to groom the horses. Having
brought no brushes or currycombs with them,
they were obliged to content themselves with rubbing
the animals down with handfuls of grass; but
they "went through the motions," as Bob expressed
it, and that was all the most exacting officer could
have expected of them under the circumstances.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as breakfast had been eaten the troopers
and their prisoners set out on the return march,
Bob and the new scout leading the way. Behind
them came the deserters, guarded on each flank and
in the rear by two cavalrymen. Their advance
was necessarily slow, for the captives had travelled
rapidly the day before in order to put a safe distance
between themselves and the fort, and they
were weary and footsore. Gus Robbins, especially,
was nearly "done up." He was in a worse condition
than Talbot was, for the latter seemed to
have slept off the effects of his wound. George
felt the greatest compassion for Gus, and offered
to lend him his horse; but Bob, who had grown
somewhat hardened to suffering during his experience
in the army, positively forbade it.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't do, George," said he, looking admiringly
at his friend's sleek, well-conditioned
animal, which was constantly champing his bit and
tossing his head as if he were growing impatient
at the slow progress they were making. "Gus
would make a break for liberty sure, and as that
nag of yours is able to distance anything in my
party, I'd have to&mdash;" Here Bob tapped his carbine
significantly. "That's something I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
want to do. Gus isn't so nearly exhausted as he
seems to be. He is more distressed in mind than
he is in body, for he is thinking of the prison at
Fort Leavenworth. After we have gone a few
miles we will rest them by taking them up behind
us, but it wouldn't be a very bright trick to give
one of them a horse to himself."</p>

<p>About eleven o'clock a halt was ordered, and
the deserters, who were riding behind the troopers,
having dismounted, Corporal Owens took Carey
off on one side and gave him some very emphatic
instructions. Then he and George also dismounted,
and, leaving their horses behind, made their way
cautiously toward a ridge a short distance in advance
of them. As they neared the top they threw
themselves on their hands and knees and crept up
until they could look over it. They were in plain
view of the squatter's cabin at which the troopers
had stopped to eat their dinner the day before.
Bob took just one look at it, and then hastily
backed down the ridge again.</p>

<p>"Did you see that fellow chopping wood in front
of the shanty?" said he, addressing himself to
George. "That's the man I am looking for."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Am I sure that I have a pair of good eyes?"
asked Bob in reply. "Of course I am. I recognized
him in spite of his citizen's clothes. That
squatter has rigged him out in some of his own
duds, but they'll not save him if I can manage in
some way to get between him and the cabin."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, in order to make 'assurance doubly
sure,' you had better take my field-glass and have
another look at him," said George. "A false
move might prove fatal to you, for it would show
the squatter that you suspect him of harboring one
of your men, and that would put both him and the
deserter on their guard. But if that is your man,
I am sorry for it."</p>

<p>"Why are you?" demanded Bob, looking at his
companion in great surprise.</p>

<p>"I mean that I am sorry you found him here,"
George hastened to explain, "for the chances are
that you will not take him without a fight. Peasley&mdash;that's
the name of the owner of the cabin&mdash;is
a notorious rough, and he would think no more of
putting a bullet into you, if he thought he could
escape the consequences, than he would of knocking
over an antelope for breakfast."</p>

<p>"I thought he looked like that kind of a chap,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
said Bob. "Well, if he wants a fight he can be
accommodated at very short notice. That's my
man, and I am going to have him, squatter or no
squatter."</p>

<p>As Bob gave utterance to this emphatic declaration
he took the field-glass, which George handed
over to him, crept up to the top of the ridge, and
after taking a short survey of the cabin and its surroundings
came back to his friend's side again.</p>

<p>"I knew I couldn't be mistaken," said he. "I
had a fair view of his face, and as I have seen him
every day for the last year, of course I couldn't
fail to recognize him. The squatter is sitting on
the porch smoking his pipe. Now, how shall I go
to work to nab him? That's the question."</p>

<p>"Ride straight up to him and tell him that you
want him," answered George. "I know of no
easier way. I will go with you and see that Peasley
doesn't double-team on you."</p>

<p>"But Bryant will run into the house the moment
he sees me," said Bob.</p>

<p>"Then run right in after him and pull him out
again," answered George promptly.</p>

<p>"I am almost afraid to do it. You see, the
civil law is supposed to be supreme, and we soldiers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
have to mind what we are about, or else there'll be
a big row raised about 'military despotism' and all
that. I'd have to surround the house and keep
him in there until I could send to the post and
get authority from the colonel to go in after him.
That is something I shouldn't like to do, for I
have carried this thing through so far without help
from anybody, and I want to complete the work
myself. If I should ask for advice, the colonel
would probably send a shoulder-strap down here
to rob me of all the glory I have won," added Bob
with a smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't laugh over it," exclaimed
George. "You have covered yourself with glory.
It isn't every fellow who would go down into a
dug-out to capture six armed men after one of them
had given positive proof that he was not afraid to
shoot. That bullet-hole in your coat is a badge of
honor. Now, I have just thought of something:
I have brought with me a full suit of Mexican
clothes, and also a saddle and bridle of the Mexican
pattern. You are just about my size&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's the very idea&mdash;nothing could be better,"
exclaimed Bob, as he arose to his feet and led the
way toward the place where he had left his men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
"It will disguise me completely, won't it? I can
ride up and get between him and the house before
he suspects anything, can't I? But how about the
squatter?"</p>

<p>"I'll join you as soon as I see that you have
corralled your man," replied George. "And you
had better tell your followers to hold themselves
in readiness to come up promptly when I signal to
them from the top of the ridge."</p>

<p>The troopers awaited the boys' return with no
little impatience, for the long consultation they had
held on the ridge convinced them that their officer
had discovered something on the other side of it.
Bob gave them a wink and a nod, which instead
of satisfying their curiosity only increased it, and
then, to the surprise of all of them, began to divest
himself of his outer clothing, while George
threw off the canvas covering that protected his
pack, and drew out of it an elegant silver-mounted
saddle and bridle, and also a suit of clothes made
in the height of the Mexican fashion.</p>

<p>"If that man of yours is at all sharp he will
notice those army-brogans the first thing, and so
you had better pull them off and put on these,"
said George, tossing a pair of light patent-leather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
shoes toward Bob. "There are the spurs. You
had better take my horse too, for that 'U. S.'
brand on your own nag would give you away in
a minute. Now go easy, like an honest Greaser
who is going about his legitimate business. Take
my mule with you, for if you try to separate him
from the horse he'll raise row enough to scare all
the deserters out of the State."</p>

<p>It is wonderful what an alteration is sometimes
made in one's appearance by a mere change of
clothing. After Bob had got into the Mexican
suit and exchanged his cap for the wide sombrero
with its gaudy cord and tassel, it was doubtful if
there was one among his brother-troopers who
would have recognized him if he had chanced to
meet him unexpectedly. Although he was not
quite yellow enough for a Mexican, he was nevertheless
pretty well tanned, and George assured him
that all he needed was a black moustache and a
long goatee to transform him into a very good-looking
Greaser.</p>

<p>Everything being in readiness, Bob mounted
George's horse, took the pack-mule's halter, which
his friend passed up to him, and, after giving
Carey instructions to bring up the squad and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
prisoners promptly when he was signalled to do
so, he rode slowly away, the new scout following
a short distance in his rear, mounted on Bob's
nag.</p>

<p>Arriving at the top of the ridge, Corporal Owens
rode over it without pausing, and had not proceeded
far before he became aware that he was
discovered. The squatter got up and came to the
end of the porch, the deserter ceased his chopping
and leaned on his axe, and both shaded
their eyes with their hands and looked at him.
It was plain that they were not very well pleased
with the result of their observations, for, after
gazing at him for a few seconds, the squatter returned
to his seat and puffed furiously at his pipe,
and the deserter resumed his chopping. At the
same moment the dogs appeared in force from
under the cabin, their every action indicating that
they had been summoned by the voice of their
master. They looked up at him, wagging their
tails vigorously, and then, encouraged, no doubt,
by a low hiss or an order to "hunt 'em up," began
running about with their heads high in the
air. Discovering the approaching horseman, they
started for him on the instant, each one striving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
to lead in the race and to growl and bark louder
than his companions.</p>

<p>"They don't think much of Greasers in this
part of the country," said Bob to himself; "and
I don't blame them. If I were a stock-raiser I
shouldn't feel very hospitably inclined toward a
class of men who are always on the watch for a
chance to jump down on me and steal my cattle.
I wonder if I shall have pluck enough to dismount
in the midst of all these dogs and make
the arrest?" added Bob as the fierce brutes closed
about him, all of them with their ears laid back
close to their heads and their hair turned the
wrong way, and some crouching at his side as
if they were about to spring up and pull him
out of his saddle.&mdash;"Get out! If you interfere
with my business there won't be as many of you
to-night as there were this morning. Aha! there's
one of you out of the muss already."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p155.jpg" alt="p155" title="Bob Captures the Deserter."/></div>
<div class="figcenter"><span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Bob Captures the Deserter.</span></span></div>

<p>For just here the mule gave a tug at his halter,
and Bob, looking over his shoulder to see what
was the matter, caught a momentary glimpse of a
tawny body as it rose in the air, and, turning a
complete somersault, landed on the ground all in
a heap. One of the dogs, in his eagerness to do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
something grand, had approached a little too close
to the mule's heels&mdash;an impertinence which that
sagacious quadruped promptly resented by kicking
out with both hind feet and knocking his would-be
assailant into a cocked hat. The dog was not
killed, but he was terribly demoralized, and his
howls of anguish did much to dampen the ardor
of his companions, who quickly withdrew to a
more respectful distance.</p>

<p>Bob rode straight up to the house, but the
squatter never looked at him, nor did the deserter
stop his work. He drew rein in front of the porch,
swung himself out of the saddle as quick as a flash,
and, paying no attention to the dogs, which bayed
him at a distance, but were too cowardly to assault
him, he walked up to the deserter and tapped him
on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Bryant, I want you," said he.</p>

<p>The deserter, whose back was turned toward Bob,
wheeled on the instant, revealing a face that was as
white as a sheet. Bob backed around a little, so
that he could keep one eye on Bryant while he
watched the squatter with the other, and saw the
man spring to his feet in the greatest astonishment,
his pipe dropping from his mouth as he arose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>"You didn't expect to see me again so soon,
did you?" said Bob, addressing himself to nobody
in particular.</p>

<p>"Corporal Owens!" gasped the deserter, retreating
a step or two, at the same time grasping
his axe firmly in both hands and lifting it over
his head. "Keep away from me; if you come
a step nearer I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Drop it!" commanded Bob sternly; and Bryant
obeyed, for he saw the muzzle of a cocked revolver
looking him squarely in the face.</p>

<p>All this happened in less time than we have
taken to tell it, but meanwhile the squatter had
not been idle. Quickly recovering from his amazement,
he darted into the cabin, and just as Bryant
dropped the threatening axe he appeared upon the
porch with his rifle in his hand. Cocking it as he
drew it to his face, he covered Bob's head with the
weapon, and said, in a voice that trembled with rage
and excitement,</p>

<p>"Look a here, young fellow, that's a game two
can play at. Lower your shootin'-iron or I'll make
daylight shine through you."</p>

<p>"Plump him over, Peasley!" cried Bryant,
"plump him over! You are not going to stand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
there and let him take me back to the fort, are
you? You promised to protect me. Plump him
over! put the dogs on him! Do something, and
be quick about it."</p>

<p>Bob bore himself with surprising courage during
this trying ordeal. He did not know at what
instant the squatter might comply with Bryant's
frantic order to "plump him over" or to "put
the dogs on him," but he never flinched. He did
not even change color; and there is every reason
to believe that his bold front saved his life.</p>

<p>"Bryant," said he in a calm voice, "don't you
know that the colonel will be sure to hear of
this, and that you are only making a bad matter
worse by holding out against the inevitable?&mdash;As
for you, Peasley, you've got the drop on me,
and you can shoot if you feel like it; but if you
do you are a gone squatter. Look there," he
added, jerking his thumb over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Peasley looked, and saw George Ackerman
coming down the ridge at a furious gallop.</p>

<p>"That is one of my backers, and there are
six more who will be along in a minute. What
did I tell you?" exclaimed Bob as the troopers
and their prisoners came into view over the top<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
of the ridge. "Now, Peasley, if you don't behave
yourself I'll take you to the fort under
arrest. I am in the discharge of my duty, and I
am not going to put up with any more nonsense."</p>

<p>The squatter lowered his rifle, looked first at
Bryant and then at the troopers, and seemed undecided
how to act. While he hesitated George
Ackerman dashed up to the porch, jumping out
of his saddle before his horse had fairly stopped,
and, knocking the dogs right and left with the
heavy cavalry sabre which he had found fastened
to Bob's saddle, he mounted the steps and laid
hold of the squatter's rifle.</p>

<p>"Peasley, what are you about?" he exclaimed
as he twisted the weapon out of the man's unresisting
grasp. "Are you a born idiot? If you
are not, don't you know that if you raise a fuss
here you won't have any roof left over your head
in less than five minutes?"</p>

<p>The squatter, muttering something under his
breath, went back to his seat and picked up his
pipe, and in a few minutes more the troopers and
their prisoners arrived. At a sign from his officer,
Loring dismounted and stood guard over Bryant,
while Bob walked up to the porch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you think of the situation now, friend
Peasley?" said he cheerfully. "I can't take that
man to the fort in those clothes, and so I would
thank you to trot out his uniform."</p>

<p>"Don't know nothing 'bout no uniform," growled
the squatter; "ain't none here."</p>

<p>"I know better," answered Bob. "There is
one here, and I must have it. You can either
bring it out yourself or I shall search for it; and
I give you fair warning that if I turn my boys
loose in your shanty they'll handle things rough.&mdash;Now,
what shall I do if that threat doesn't start
him?" said Bob to himself. "I'll search the
cabin and take the consequences; that's what I'll
do."</p>

<p>"Come, Peasley, save yourself trouble by bringing
out the uniform," said George. "There's no
use in being a fool."</p>

<p>The squatter evidently began to think so too,
for he sullenly rose from his seat and went into
the cabin, coming out again in a few minutes with
a bundle of clothing, which he threw spitefully
down upon the porch. Bob quietly picked it up,
and, carrying it down to Bryant, commanded him
to pull off the squatter's clothes and put on his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
own; and Bryant at once complied, for he knew
that if he did not Bob would detail two or three
men to make the exchange for him. The new
prisoner was then ordered to fall in with the rest,
and the cavalcade once more took up its line of
march for the fort; but a short stop was made as
soon as they were out of sight of the squatter's
cabin, during which Bob pulled off his disguise
and put on his own garments.</p>

<p>"If I am ever obliged to wear this suit, I hope
it will serve me as well as it has served you to-day,"
said George as he stowed the Mexican costume
away in his pack and placed the silver-mounted
saddle and bridle on top of it. "I didn't think
it would so soon be brought into use."</p>

<p>"If it hadn't been for that same suit I might
have got myself into trouble," said Bob. "Knowing
where Bryant was, I never should have gone
back to the fort without him, and if he had taken
refuge in the house I might have gone in after
him. What the colonel would have said to me if
I had done that, I don't know."</p>

<p>During the ride to the fort Bob Owens, to quote
from the troopers, "laughed all over." It was
plain to everybody that he was highly elated over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the results of the expedition, as he had an undoubted
right to be. The pursuit and capture of the
deserters had been conducted with considerable
skill, and with as much determination as any veteran
officer could have exhibited. Now that the
danger was over, and his efforts to carry out the
orders of his superior had been crowned with complete
success, Bob was rather proud of that bullet-hole
in his coat.</p>

<p>The next time the order was given for the troopers
to take the prisoners on their horses, George
beckoned to Gus Robbins, who quickly mounted behind
him. After conversing a while upon the various
exciting incidents that had transpired while
Gus was Ned Ackerman's guest at George's ranche,
the latter said,</p>

<p>"I never expected to meet you again, and I
would rather not have met you at all than see you
in this scrape."</p>

<p>"Well, it can't be helped now," answered Gus,
with a weak unsuccessful attempt to appear defiant.
"The colonel told me just what I might expect if I
were ever again court-marshaled for desertion, and
I went at it with my eyes open. I am not sorry I
tried it, but I am sorry I didn't get away. If they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
don't watch me pretty closely, they will never have
a chance to take me to Leavenworth."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose your father will say when
he finds it out?" asked George.</p>

<p>"He will never find it out if I can help it."</p>

<p>"Don't you correspond with him?"</p>

<p>"Not by a great sight. He doesn't know
whether I am dead or alive. I wish I had
changed my name when I enlisted."</p>

<p>"He lives in Foxboro', Ohio, I believe?" said
George.</p>

<p>Gus replied that he did.</p>

<p>"Is his name Gus too?"</p>

<p>"No; his name is Thomas, and he is&mdash;I say,"
exclaimed Gus suddenly, "what are you asking so
many questions for? Do you intend to write to
him about me?"</p>

<p>"Why, what object could I possibly have in doing
that?" asked George, turning a very innocent-looking
face toward the deserter. "I am sure it
is none of my business what you do. Let's talk
about something else. We are getting over the
ground pretty rapidly now, and if Bob would let
me I could land you in the fort in four hours. I
don't suppose that you are in any hurry to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
there, but what I meant was, that your additional
weight would not prevent this horse of mine from
travelling from here to the fort at his very best
licks."</p>

<p>"No, I don't weigh much now," said Gus with
a sigh. "Hard work, hard fare, hard treatment
and constant worry have brought me down to a
hundred and ten pounds."</p>

<p>"That's not very heavy for a seventeen-year-old
boy."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am nineteen," said Gus, "but just now
I feel as though I were forty."</p>

<p>"And you look so, too," said George to himself.&mdash;"That
was the reason I wanted to know
your exact age."</p>

<p>George had now learned all he cared to know
about Gus Robbins. He was a minor, his father's
name was Thomas and he lived in Foxboro', Ohio.
He had gone to work in a roundabout way to gain
this information, because he was afraid that if he
asked Gus leading questions and told him what use
he intended to make of his answers, the deserter
would refuse to open his head. He had gained his
point by strategy, and he did not intend that Gus
should go to Leavenworth if he could help it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob's supply of rations being nearly exhausted,
his men and the deserters had a very scant dinner,
and they did not get anything more to eat until
they reached the fort. About ten o'clock that
night they were challenged by one of the sentries,
and, not knowing the countersign, were obliged to
wait until the corporal of the guard was called.
Having at last been admitted inside of the stockade,
Bob marched up in front of head-quarters,
where he ordered a halt, and he and George dismounted
and went in to report to the colonel.
Bob was very much astonished at the manner in
which the officer greeted the new scout, and so was
the orderly. They had never before seen him unbend
to anybody as he did to George. Having
never been admitted into head-quarters except when
they had business there&mdash;some report to make, some
orders to receive or some sharp reprimand to listen
to&mdash;they knew the commandant only as a stern,
exacting officer who seemed to care for nothing
but the "regulations," and they had never imagined
that he could be cordial or friendly with
any one. But now they saw their mistake. The
colonel got up from his seat, shook the boy warmly
by the hand, told him he was glad to see him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
called him by his Christian name and pointed him
to an easy-chair, while Bob was left to stand at attention
until the colonel got ready to attend to
him.</p>

<p>"You are all ready for business I see, George,"
said the colonel as he resumed his seat at the table.
"Well, I'll give you a taste of army-life by sending
you out on a scout to-morrow. I will tell you
about it pretty soon. There's your room," he added,
pointing to an apartment adjoining his own,
"and when you get ready you can bring in your
luggage. The officer of the day will show you
where to put your horse. You will have to be
your own servant, unless you are willing to hire
a civilian and pay him out of your own pocket.
I saw that you came in with Corporal Owens:
did he arrest you?"</p>

<p>"He was going to, sir," replied George, "but
let me off when I showed him my furlough."</p>

<p>"Corporal," continued the colonel, turning to
Bob, who stood lost in wonder, "what report
have you to make?"</p>

<p>"I have the honor, sir, to report my entire
success," was Bob's reply; "I've got them all."</p>

<p>"Where are they now?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>"On the parade, under guard, sir."</p>

<p>"Very good. Keep them there until further
orders. Tell the officer of the day I want to
see him."</p>

<p>George thought this was rather hard. Bob had
risked his life and displayed most commendable
zeal and ability in carrying out the colonel's orders,
and now the latter dismissed him without
one single word to indicate that he appreciated
his services. Why did he not question the corporal
in regard to the manner in which the capture
of the deserters had been effected, and reward
him for his gallantry by making him a sergeant
on the spot? That was what George thought <i>he</i>
would have done if he had been commandant of
the post, and he then and there resolved that a
full history of Bob's exploit should be laid before
the colonel before he went to sleep that
night.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">TOP</a></span>
<h3>GEORGE AT THE FORT.</h3>


<p>"Colonel, that young fellow has had a very
hard time of it," said George when Bob had
closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>"I expected it," replied the officer carelessly.
"It is a wonder to me that the deserters didn't
kill him, for there were some hard characters
among them and they were well armed."</p>

<p>This remark would seem to indicate that the
colonel was a most unfeeling man, and that he
did not set much if any value upon the life of a
non-commissioned officer; but such was not really
the case. When he was a subaltern his superiors
had often assigned to him some very hazardous
undertakings, and when he attained to a rank
that entitled him to a command he sent others
into danger and thought nothing of it. A soldier's
first and last duty was to obey any orders he might
receive, and if he lost his life while in the act of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
executing those orders, why, it was nothing more
than might be expected.</p>

<p>"They did try to kill him," said George.
"Didn't you notice that hole in the breast of his
coat?"</p>

<p>"I did, and I thought it looked as though it
had been made by a bullet."</p>

<p>"So it was. Bristow shot at him. He wanted
to be revenged on Bob for telling you about those
thirty men who tried to desert some time ago, and
if he had been a little better marksman you would
have been put to the trouble of appointing a new
corporal in the place of as brave a boy as ever
swung a sabre."</p>

<p>"Why, George," exclaimed the colonel, becoming
interested, "you are quite enthusiastic. Do
you know Corporal Owens?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He is the one who pulled me out
of the river on the night the old Sam Kendall
was burned."</p>

<p>"Oh yes; you told me about that the first
time you were here. Where did the corporal find
Bristow and his party?"</p>

<p>George answered this question by giving the
colonel a circumstantial account of the pursuit, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
he had heard it from Bob's lips, and the manner
in which he had gone to work to secure the deserters
after he had discovered their place of refuge.
His description of Bryant's arrest amused
the officer, who declared that it was a very neat
piece of strategy.</p>

<p>Having placed Bob's case in the most favorable
light possible, George then went on to tell the colonel
about Springer's unexpected visit to his ranche,
and described in detail the intended movements of
Fletcher and his band. The officer said he had
done right in sending the cattle-thief to warn the
commandant at Eagle Pass, and had no doubt that
that officer would take measures to assist the civil
authorities at Rio Grande City in protecting the
jail and giving Fletcher and his men a warm
reception when they came across the river; but, in
order to explain what happened afterward, we must
here say that he did nothing of the kind. Unfortunately
for Springer, he was recognized by some
ranchemen who happened to be hanging about the
post, and in spite of his protestations he was arrested
and turned over to the marshal, who locked him up.
No attention whatever was paid to his warning, and
so positive was the marshal that there was "some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>thing
back of it" that he would not even permit
the prisoner to tell his story.</p>

<p>The cattle-thief remained in jail until the next
full moon, and then Fletcher and his men suddenly
made their appearance, just as Springer said they
would. As no precautions had been taken to guard
the prison, the raiders had an easy victory, and before
assistance could arrive from the Pass, Springer
and the murderers of the cowboy had been released
and Fletcher was safe across the river. Springer,
of course, was much too sharp to tell how he came
to be an inmate of the jail, and the boss cattle-thief,
believing that he had been arrested while trying to
carry out his instructions, treated him with the
greatest consideration.</p>

<p>"What did you mean by saying that you would
give me a taste of army-life by sending me out on
a scout to-morrow?" asked George after he had
finished his story. "Any raiding going on about
here?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes. I am going to send Clinton out to
punish a war-party of Kiowas if he can catch them.
I am aware you are used to roughing it, but you
know nothing about campaigning with troops, and I
thought I would give you a chance to get your hand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
in before I call upon you to lead us across the river.
Some young bucks belonging to Satanta's band, the
most of them mere boys, have broken away from
their agency and come down here in pursuit of scalps
and fame. Among other outrages which they have
committed, they jumped down on a poor fellow the
other day, killed or scattered his herdsmen, drove
off his stock and carried his two children into captivity.
I should like to be the means of ridding
the frontier of that villain, for he is dangerous.
During a peace-council that was held at Fort Dodge
some time ago, Satanta talked so glibly about his
desire to cultivate friendly relations with us, and
his unalterable determination to 'follow the white
man's road' in future, that he really succeeded in
making the commissioners believe that he was sincere
in what he said. To encourage him in his
good resolutions, the department commander and
staff presented him with a uniform coat and sash
and a brigadier-general's hat. How the wily old
scoundrel must have laughed in his sleeve when he
saw how completely he had bamboozled some of
our best soldiers!"</p>

<p>"How long did he keep his promise?" asked
George.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>"About three weeks, and then he led an attack,
dressed in his new uniform, against the fort in
which the council was held. Oh, he's a good one!
I know you didn't come here to fight Indians, but
you'll have to hold yourself in readiness for anything
that turns up."</p>

<p>"You will always find me around when you
want me," replied George. "May I write a letter
here?" he continued, seeing that the colonel picked
up his pen and turned to his table to resume
some writing in which he had been interrupted
when Bob and the new scout came in to report.</p>

<p>"Certainly. There are pens, ink and paper; help
yourself. There's the letter-box over there. The
mail-carrier goes out to-morrow."</p>

<p>Before George could begin work on his letter
the officer of the day came in. He shook hands
with the new-comer, to whom he had been introduced
on the occasion of the boy's first visit to
the fort, and was told by the colonel to put the
deserters into the guard-house, to show George
where to stake out his horse and mule, and to
see that he had somebody to help him bring in
his pack-saddle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>The work of bringing in his luggage and taking
care of his animals was soon performed, and then
George came back and began his letter. It took
him a long time to write it, for he wanted to make
it one that would produce an impression upon the
person to whom it was addressed. It was to Gus
Robbins's father. It conveyed to that gentleman
the information that although his son was alive
and in fair bodily health, he had brought himself
into serious trouble, having been detected in two
attempts at desertion, and unless his friends at
home interested themselves in his behalf he had
a fair prospect of going to prison. If Mr. Robbins
would move in the matter he could easily procure
the culprit's discharge from the service, for he
was a minor and had enlisted without his father's
consent; but if there was anything done it must
be done quickly, for it was probable that a court-martial
would be convened in a very few days.
Having sealed and addressed the letter, he bade
the colonel good-night and went to bed, feeling
satisfied that he had done all he could for the
unfortunate Gus.</p>

<p>George slept soundly, as he always did, but the
morning gun and the first notes of reveille awoke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
him. While he was making his toilet with his
usual care and deliberation&mdash;as we have said, his
long intercourse with river-dandies had made him
very particular on this point&mdash;his friend, Bob
Owens, and the men who occupied the quarters
with him, were hurrying on their clothes in order
to get into line in time to answer to their names
at roll-call. While they were dressing they talked,
and this was a portion of the conversation that
took place between the corporal and one of the
colonel's orderlies&mdash;the same one who had been
on duty when Bob went in to report his arrival
with the deserters.</p>

<p>"I say, Owens," exclaimed the orderly, "who
was that nobby young officer who came in with
you last night? What is his name, and what rank
does he hold? I know he is green, for he didn't
know enough to put on a dress-coat before he went
into the colonel's presence."</p>

<p>"His name is George Ackerman," answered Bob,
"but he is not an officer; he's a scout."</p>

<p>"'A scout'!" repeated the orderly in a tone of
contempt. "He is a pretty-looking scout, I must
say. What does he know about life on the
Plains?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>"He knows a good deal more about it than anybody
in this room, for he was born right here in
Texas," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Has he ever seen service?"</p>

<p>"No, but he knows what danger is, and he has
been in some situations that you wouldn't care to
be placed in. During long months of his life he
lived in constant fear of a violent death."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt that he told you so, but I don't
believe it, all the same," observed the orderly.</p>

<p>"I can't help that. I am personally acquainted
with him, and you are not. I was with him when
the steamer to which he belonged was burned on
the Mississippi River, and came to Texas with him.
He owns a big cattle-ranche a few miles from here,
and has an income of about forty thousand dollars
a year."</p>

<p>"Aha! that accounts for the milk in the cocoa-nut,"
exclaimed the orderly. "I know now why
it was that the colonel met him in so friendly a
manner. Even those stern old regulars soften in
the presence of one who was born with a silver
spoon in his mouth, don't they?"</p>

<p>"But George Ackerman's money didn't get him
the position he holds," said Bob quickly. "He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
has been a prisoner among the cattle-thieves on
the other side of the river, and knows where they
hang out. He is here to act as our guide when
we pursue the raiders across the river."</p>

<p>"What did the cattle-thieves take him prisoner
for?"</p>

<p>"Because they were promised twenty thousand
dollars for it by George's guardian, who wanted
to get him out of the way, so that his son could
inherit George's property. But he managed to
escape from them, went up North and became a
pilot, and it was while he was serving in that capacity
that I made his acquaintance."</p>

<p>"That's a very pretty story," remarked the orderly,
"but doesn't it sound almost too much like
a dime novel?"</p>

<p>"If you don't believe it ask Gus Robbins, if
you get a chance to speak to him. He knows
George, and has reason to be grateful to him too.
Gus came down here to visit Ned Ackerman while
the latter's father was acting as George's guardian,
and got himself into trouble that would have ended
seriously if George had not befriended him.
It was through that same visit that Gus got into
the army."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you hear what the colonel said to him
about a servant?" asked the orderly. "Whoever
saw a scout with a servant? I never did, and
neither did I ever before see a man holding that
position treated with so much consideration by a
post-commander. I can't account for it."</p>

<p>Bob could not account for it either, and so he
attempted no explanation. We may tell the reader
that there were two good reasons for it. In the
first place, George was not a regular scout; he
might, with more propriety, have been called a
volunteer aide. It is true that he was sworn into
the service, and that he was bound to do his duty
faithfully "during the pleasure of the commanding
officer" of Fort Lamoine, but he drew no
pay from the government. He did not even ask
that he should be fed while he lived at the fort,
but stood ready to pay his share of the mess-bill.
He had freely offered his services as guide to the
troops because he, in common with every rancheman
and farmer in that country, wanted the raiding-parties
broken up, and he believed that he
could do as much, if not more, toward accomplishing
that object than any other single civilian. He
was not obliged to wear a uniform (being sworn in,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
he had a <i>right</i> to wear it), but he had purchased it
for the same reason that he had purchased the
Mexican costume and the other clothing he had
brought with him&mdash;because he believed it might
some day be of use to him. We have already
seen how one of his disguises came into play. If
he had not brought with him that Mexican suit,
it is hard to tell how Bryant would have been
captured.</p>

<p>In the next place, the colonel was an old acquaintance
and friend of George's father. He
had often enjoyed Mr. Ackerman's hospitality, and
he could say, with Zeke, that he had carried George
in his arms when the latter was a "yelling baby
not knee-high to a duck," and when he himself
was nothing but a second lieutenant. Since that
time a great many things had happened. Mr.
Ackerman and his wife were dead, the second
lieutenant had passed through a terrible war, had
worn a major-general's shoulder-straps in the
volunteer army and won a brevet colonelcy in
the regulars, and George had grown almost to
manhood. Neither of them knew of the presence
of the other in that country until George, accompanied
by Mr. Gilbert and a few other ranchemen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
came to the fort to offer his services. The colonel
knew the boy as soon as he heard his name, and it
was on account of the respect and affection he cherished
for the memory of his father that he extended
so cordial a greeting to him; but, like all the other
soldiers who had seen him, the colonel did not think
that George was just the guide he wanted.</p>

<p>"I need somebody with age and experience,
George," said he, "and you have neither. I know
you can handle a herd of cattle and manage your
ranche in good style, but I am not so certain of
your ability to act as guide to my troops. I admire
your pluck, and I should be glad to have you
come here and live until you get tired of it; and
in order to make it lawful for you to stay here, I
will give you a position as forage-master."</p>

<p>"I am very much obliged to you, sir, but that
is a berth I don't want," answered George. "I
want to help put down those raiders."</p>

<p>"But just think of the responsibility that would
rest upon you," protested the colonel. "A single
blunder on your part might cripple me fearfully."</p>

<p>"You need have no fears on that score," said
Mr. Gilbert. "George is good wherever you put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
him. He is acquainted with Fletcher, who is the
most active of all the raiders who trouble us; he
knows where he hangs out, and he is the only
one on this side of the river who does. When
it comes to trailing, he is at home there too.
Can you look at a trail and tell how old it is
and how many men or horses made it?"</p>

<p>No, the colonel couldn't do that. He always
looked to his scouts for information on those
points.</p>

<p>"George can do it," said Mr. Gilbert. "He
has served his time under one of the best trailers
in the country; and that is Zeke, his herdsman."</p>

<p>After a little more conversation the colonel,
although not without many misgivings, accepted
the offer of George's services; and he never had
occasion to regret it. During the very first expedition
that was sent out of the fort after he
reported there for duty he showed what he was
made of, and gave the colonel reason for placing
almost unlimited confidence in his judgment.
Acting as Bob Owens's counsellor, he enabled
the latter to perform an exploit that made him
the lion of the post.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>Having dressed himself, George passed through
the colonel's office and out through the hall to
the parade. In the outer door was seated a man
who was bent half double, with his elbows resting
on his knees and his face buried in his hands.
Hearing the sound of the boy's footsteps, he raised
his head, revealing a countenance so haggard and
sorrowful that George was startled at the sight of
it. The man moved aside to allow him room to
pass, and then covered his face with his hands
again, and as George walked out he was sure
he heard him utter a suppressed moan. The
man was not a soldier, for he was dressed in
citizen's clothes. He looked like a rancheman;
and as George was a rancheman himself, he naturally
felt some sympathy for the unknown sufferer.
After hesitating a moment, weighing in
his mind the propriety of the step he was about
to take, he turned back and asked,</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you, sir? Are you
ill?"</p>

<p>"'Ill'?" repeated the man, without looking up.
"Worse than that&mdash;worse than that."</p>

<p>"Is there anything that I can do for you?" asked
George. "You seem to be in great trouble."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>As these words fell upon his ear the man
straightened up, and, gazing at George with a pair
of wild-looking eyes, said, in a voice that was rendered
husky by some strong emotion,</p>

<p>"I am in trouble, partner, and although I do
not think you can help me in any way, I feel
grateful to you for your sympathy. I have been
bounced by the hostiles and cleaned out&mdash;completely
cleaned out."</p>

<p>"That <i>is</i> bad," returned George, who told himself
that the man took his loss very much to heart.
He knew a good many stock-raisers who had been
"bounced" and "cleaned out," but he had never
before seen one who seemed to be so utterly broken
down by his misfortunes as this one did.
The stranger's next words, however, explained it
all.</p>

<p>"The loss of my ranche and stock I don't
mind," said he; "that's nothing. But when one
sees his two motherless boys carried off by the red
fiends, while he is powerless to help them, it's
pretty rough, it's pretty rough."</p>

<p>"Why, this must be the man the colonel told
me about last night," said George to himself.</p>

<p>"I should not fear that the savages would raise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
their hands against the lives of the boys (they are
too young to be put to torture, one being eight and
the other ten years of age) if it were not for one
thing," continued the bereaved father, jumping to
his feet and pacing back and forth like a caged tiger.
"I made a hard fight of it, and dropped a Kiowa
for every year of my oldest boy's age. Of course
the death of those warriors will have to be avenged
by their relatives. Perhaps you don't know it,
but that is Indian law."</p>

<p>"I do know it," interrupted George. "I
couldn't have lived so close to these raiders, both
Indians and Mexicans, nearly all my life without
learning something about their ways, could I? I
am a Texan, like yourself."</p>

<p>"You are? I took you for a Yankee soldier."</p>

<p>"There's where you made a mistake," replied
George. "I was born in Miller county in this
State, and I am here to act as guide to the troops
when they cross the river in pursuit of the cattle-thieves."</p>

<p>"Good! Put it there!" exclaimed the man, extending
his hand, while his face for the moment
showed the pleasure he felt at the meeting. "My
name is Wentworth; what is yours?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>George told him, and Mr. Wentworth said he
had often heard the name, and in a roundabout
way had learned something of the family history.</p>

<p>"I have heard of you too," said George. "You
have often been obliged to run in order to save
your life and stock, have you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I have always succeeded in getting
safely away; but there is a first time for everybody,
and mine came three days ago. I was going
on to say that I am afraid the savages will
take vengeance on my helpless little boys for the
braves I shot in the fight," continued Mr. Wentworth.
"If they don't do that, they will probably
hold them for ransom; but they might as
well tomahawk the boys at once and put them
out of their misery, for I haven't a horn nor a
hoof nor a cent of money to give in exchange
for them. I know I have seen them for the last
time, but won't I make it hot for those who stole
them?"</p>

<p>George could not say anything comforting. The
sight of the strong man's overwhelming grief struck
him dumb.</p>

<p>"I know some of the bucks who were in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
fight," continued Mr. Wentworth, grinding his
teeth and rubbing his hands nervously together.
"They have often camped on my ranche when
they came down here buffalo-hunting. I don't
care what treaties our government may make with
that tribe; there will be eternal war between me
and them. No Kiowa shall ever cross my trail
and live&mdash;no, not if I hang for it. I only wish
that some of those peace commissioners&mdash;those
lunatics who believe that an Indian is a human
being and needs only kind treatment to make
him peaceable and friendly&mdash;could stand in my
boots this minute. I tell you, Ackerman, if one
of them were here now I'd stand and see an
Indian shoot him, and never lift a hand in his
defence. I got in last night and told the colonel
about it, and he said he would send out a couple
of companies this morning with orders to overtake
and punish them if possible; but he might
as well save his men and horses, for it isn't possible.
They have reached the Staked Plains by
this time, and are safe from pursuit. This is a
lovely government for a white man to live under,
isn't it? It is too cowardly to protect us from
the Mexicans, and too tender-hearted to hang<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
an Indian for murder unless he happens to kill
some one high in authority, like General Canby."</p>

<p>Mr. Wentworth seemed almost beside himself
when he thought of his boys, who were now so
many miles away from him, for then it was that
he realized how powerless he was to help them.
He went on in this strain until he had talked
himself out of breath, and then he went back
to his seat on the doorstep and covered his face
with his hands.</p>

<h3>WHAT GEORGE KNEW ABOUT TRAILING.</h3>


<p>"It is a hard case," said George to himself
as he walked slowly toward the gate, "and
I believe, as Mr. Wentworth does, that he has
seen his children for the last time. In the first
place, the chances are that the Indians, having so
long a start, will not be overtaken; but if they
go out of their way to attack other isolated
ranches, and the troops should come up with
them, their very first act, if they saw that they
were likely to be whipped, would be to kill their
captives, so that they could not be rescued. It
<i>is</i> a hard case, that's a fact, and I don't see that
anything can be done about it. I wish Zeke were
here to give his opinion on the subject."</p>

<p>The troopers, having answered to the names, were
going out to bring in their horses preparatory to
grooming them, and George went with them to
bring in his own. Nearly an hour was devoted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
to this important duty, which was performed under
the watchful eye of an officer, and although
George often saw his friend Bob, the latter did
not speak to him. There were a good many shoulder-straps
around, and work, and not talk, was the
order of the day. Even those of the officers who,
having no servants, were obliged to act as their
own grooms, had very little to say to one another;
but when these same officers were gathered around
the breakfast-table half an hour later, they were
lively and talkative enough. There they met
on a footing of perfect equality, like the members
of a private family, although the juniors did not
forget to say "sir" when addressing their superiors.
There were no orders issued during the progress
of the meal, and in fact very little was said about
military matters; but still, George heard enough
to satisfy him that active operations against the
thieving Kiowas were to be commenced immediately,
and that he was to make one of an expedition
upon whose success a good deal depended.</p>

<p>The appearance of the officers as they passed
into the hall after rising from the breakfast-table
must have been a signal to the bugler who stood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
in front of the door of head-quarters, for as soon
as he saw them he raised his instrument to his
lips and blew a shrill call. The clear, ringing
notes had scarcely ceased when there was a commotion
in the barracks, and a crowd of men came
pouring out and hurried toward the stables. There
were a hundred and twenty of them, and they
belonged to the troops A, E and L&mdash;the latter
commonly called the "Brindles"&mdash;of which Captain
Clinton's scouting-party was to be composed.</p>

<p>"That's 'Boots and saddles,' George," said the
colonel, who stood in the doorway appearing to
notice nothing, but in reality keeping a close watch
over the movements of the men to see that everything
was done in accordance with the "regulations."
"You are to go with Clinton, you know.
Are you ready?"</p>

<p>"I will be in half a minute," replied the
boy.</p>

<p>The stirring notes of the bugle, or the prospect
of soon meeting face to face some of the bloodthirsty
savages who had devastated Mr. Wentworth's
home, must have excited George, so that
he did not readily lay his hand upon the articles
he wanted, for considerably more than half a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
minute elapsed before he again appeared with
his Winchester on his back, a bag of cartridges
slung over his shoulder and a revolver buckled
about his waist. He ran to the stable, and had
just put the saddle and bridle on his horse when
another call of the bugle was heard. This was
"To horse," and in obedience the troopers left
the stable and fell into line on the parade, each
man standing at the head of his nag. George
did not belong in line&mdash;in fact, he did not know
where he <i>did</i> belong&mdash;so he kept his eye on Captain
Clinton, and when he saw that officer mount
the horse which an orderly brought up to him,
George at once placed himself in his own saddle,
and, riding up to the steps where the colonel
was standing, awaited further developments.</p>

<p>"Prepare to mount!" commanded Captain Clinton
as he rode up in front of his own troop, and
the words were immediately repeated by the other
two company commanders.</p>

<p>In obedience to this order each trooper placed
his left foot in the stirrup, and at the command
"Mount!" which was given soon after, they all
rose from the ground as if moved by the same
set of springs, and seated themselves in the saddles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
at the same instant. No man was a half a second
ahead or behind his companions. The three company
officers then rode back to the colonel to report
that their respective companies were ready to
march, and after they had listened to some verbal
instructions from him, they bade him and the rest
of the officers good-bye, the bugle sounded the
"Advance," and the troopers, moving four abreast&mdash;or,
as a soldier would have expressed it, in column
of fours&mdash;rode out of the gate. There they found
Wentworth seated on a wiry little mustang, which
looked altogether too small to carry so heavy a
rider. Recognizing George, who rode by Captain
Clinton's side, he gave him a friendly nod, and
without saying a word turned his horse and rode
away, the troopers following a short distance in
his rear.</p>

<p>When soldiers are on the march and in no danger
of immediate contact with the enemy, they are
allowed numerous privileges, of which the troopers
composing this particular scouting-party were not
slow to avail themselves. Some of them drew
their pipes from their pockets and filled up for a
smoke, others threw one leg over the horns of their
saddles and rode sideways, "woman-fashion," and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
conversation became general all along the line.
But this talking and smoking did not interfere
with their marching, for they rode rapidly, and
made such good progress that by three o'clock in
the afternoon they were within sight of the ruins
of Mr. Wentworth's ranche. And a sorry sight
it was, too. Nothing but a pile of blackened sun-dried
bricks remained to mark the spot on which a
few days ago had stood a happy home. Household
furniture of every description was scattered around,
but every article had been smashed beyond all hope
of repair. What the savages had not been able to
carry away with them they had ruthlessly destroyed.
George did not wonder that Mr. Wentworth
felt vindictive. The man did not have a word to
say, but the expression that came to his face as he
sat in his saddle gazing sorrowfully at the ruins of
his home spoke volumes.</p>

<p>When the troopers came within sight of the
ranche, George discovered that there was a horse
staked out near the ruins, and that he had an
owner in the person of a tall, gaunt man, who rose
from the ground and rubbed his eyes as if he had
just awakened from a sound sleep. His dress was
an odd mixture of the civilized and savage. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
wore a pair of infantryman's trousers, a rancheman's
red shirt, and an Indian blanket of the
same color was thrown over his shoulders. His
head was covered by a Mexican sombrero, and his
feet were protected by a pair of gaudily-ornamented
moccasins. While waiting for the troopers to
come up he filled a short black pipe and lighted it
at the smoldering fire beside which he had been
sleeping.</p>

<p>"That's Mountain Mose," said Captain Clinton
in reply to George's inquiring look. "He no
doubt gave himself the name because he has lived
on the Plains all his life. He is a lazy, worthless
vagabond, but what he doesn't know about Indians
isn't worth knowing. If he would only wake up
and display a little energy, he would be invaluable
as a scout."</p>

<p>"What is he doing here?" asked George. "He
seems to be waiting for us."</p>

<p>"Yes, I expected to find him at this place. He
has been out to take a look at the trail of that war-party
who did all this damage.&mdash;Well, Mose, any
news?"</p>

<p>"Not much, cap," drawled the scout. "You
put straight for the Staked Plains, an' if you are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
lively enough to ketch 'em anywhar, you'll ketch
'em thar."</p>

<p>"Then we shall never get the cattle," said the
captain. "If the Indians are going in there, they
intend that the stock shall die of thirst rather than
fall into our hands."</p>

<p>"That's jest their little game, cap," said the
scout, puffing at his pipe. "You see, they'll keep
along on the edge of the desert, so't they can have
grass an' water in plenty, an' if you don't pester
'em none they won't go into the Staked Plains at
all; but if you push 'em hard they'll run the critters
in thar an' leave 'em, hopin' that you will
run your hosses an' men to death while you are
huntin' 'em up. You won't never see the young
ones, nuther; an' I don't see why the colonel sent
out sich a party as this so late in the day, anyhow.
We'd oughter been a hundred miles along that thar
trail by sun-up this mornin'."</p>

<p>George felt the deepest sympathy for Mr. Wentworth,
who listened attentively to what the scout
had to say, although he said nothing in return.
His almost overwhelming sorrow showed itself
in his face, but did not take the form of words.</p>

<p>As Captain Clinton had made no halt for din<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>ner,
the colonel having instructed him to find and
receive the report of the scout as soon as possible,
he decided to stop here and allow his men an hour
or two for rest and refreshment. Giving their
horses into the charge of some of the troopers,
he and his two company commanders walked
away with the scout, while George rode off to
hunt up Bob Owens. He staked his own horse
out beside Bob's, and then walked back with him
to take a nearer view of the ruins.</p>

<p>"How do you suppose that that man in the
sombrero and moccasins knows that the Indians
who did this have fled toward the Staked Plains?"
asked Bob after he and his friend had spent some
moments in silent contemplation of the savages'
handiwork. "He certainly hasn't had time enough
to follow the trail clear to those plains."</p>

<p>"Of course not," answered George. "But he
probably followed it far enough to see that it
leads in that direction."</p>

<p>"Well, explain another thing while you are
about it," continued Bob. "I have been out on
a scout before now after the hostiles, following a
trail that was as plain as the nose on one's face,
when all at once the scout would leave that trail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
and strike off over the prairie where there wasn't
a sign of a pony-track."</p>

<p>"He was taking a short cut on the Indians,"
observed George.</p>

<p>"I know that, and sooner or later he would
bring us back to that trail again; and sometimes
we would have gained so much on the hostiles&mdash;who
had perhaps been twenty-four hours' journey
ahead of us when we left the trail&mdash;that we would
find their camp-fires still smoking. Now, what
I want to know is this: How did that scout know
that those Indians were going to that particular
spring or creek or ravine near which we found
the trail?"</p>

<p>"Have you ever hunted foxes?" asked George.</p>

<p>"I should say I had. When I left home I
owned a hound that couldn't be beaten in running
them, for he was posted in all their tricks.
But what have foxes to do with hostile Indians?"</p>

<p>"I am simply going to use the tricks of the
one, which you understand, to explain the tricks
of the other, which you do not understand," replied
George. "They are a good deal alike in
some respects. A fox, when he finds himself hard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
pressed, will resort to all sorts of manoeuvres to
throw the hounds off the trail. One of his tricks
is to run over a newly-ploughed field, if he can
find one, where the scent will not lie. What would
that brag hound of yours do in such a case? Would
he waste valuable time in running about over that
field trying to pick up a scent that wasn't there?"</p>

<p>"No, he wouldn't. He would run around the
outside of the field until he found the place where
the fox left it."</p>

<p>"Exactly. Now, an Indian is just as full of
tricks as a fox is. When he is afraid of pursuit
he will break his party up into small bands, and,
although the trails made by these bands will lead
in different directions at the start, you will find,
if you break up your own party and follow them
for a while, that they all tend toward the same
points, where these little bands will all be reunited.
Of course each of the trails will be obliterated
as much as possible. Some of them will lead over
rocky ground, where the hoof of a pony will
leave no imprint; others will come to an abrupt
termination on the bank of some stream; and
others still will end at a place where the prairie
has been burned over. When these war-parties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
break up in the way I have described, a place of
meeting is always agreed on beforehand; and if
a scout understands his business he can tell pretty
nearly where that place is, for it is sure to be on
the straightest and most direct route to the agency
if the raiders belong to a 'friendly' tribe, or to
their principal village if they belong to a tribe
that is openly hostile. If these Kiowas take to
the Staked Plains, they will probably enter it
directly north of here, at its widest part. Then
this Mountain Mose, if he is the scout he pretends
to be, will leave their trail to take care of itself
and draw a bee-line for the nearest water; and it
will take thirty hours' rapid marching to reach it,
too."</p>

<p>"How do you know? Have you ever been
there?"</p>

<p>"No, but my herdsman Zeke has; and he has
described the course to be followed so minutely
that I can go there any day the sun shines or any
night when the stars shine."</p>

<p>Bob did not say anything, but his friend noticed
that he looked a little incredulous.</p>

<p>"It is not so difficult as it appears to be at first
glance," George hastened to say. "Why, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
a party of young Indians want to go into a strange
country for plunder and scalps, they gather around
some old warrior, who traces on the ground the direction
in which they must travel in order to reach
that country, describes all the water-courses and
locates the principal landmarks to be found along
the route; and with nothing but these verbal instructions
to guide them, these little rascals, some
of them not more than thirteen or fourteen years
of age, will make a journey of hundreds of miles
through a region that none of them have ever
visited before. My bump of locality is not so
large as an Indian's, but still I have a pretty good
memory, and I have travelled many a mile through
a strange country without going a step out of my
way."</p>

<p>"What sort of a looking place is Staked Plains,
anyhow?" asked Bob. "I have heard so many terrible
stories told about it that I am almost afraid
of it. What gave it that name? Are there any
<i>stakes</i> there?"</p>

<p>Bob was inclined to be facetious when he said
this, and consequently he was not a little astonished
to hear George say in reply,</p>

<p>"There may not be any stakes there now, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
there used to be. It <i>is</i> a terrible place, and many
a wagon-train has left its bones there. It is big
enough to get lost in, for it lacks only about six
thousand square-miles of being as large as the State
of New York; and although it is not exactly a
desert, as we understand the word, it is a barren
waste, where nothing living permanently resides
on account of the great scarcity of water. A long
time ago the Mexican traders marked out a route
with stakes across the plain where they found a
few small fountains, and that was what gave it the
name it bears. Zeke says it is a perfect bake-oven.
There are no trees to shelter you, no grass for your
horses, no fuel to build a fire with, and an almost
unearthly silence broods over it. I am not superstitious,
but Zeke always speaks of it with a shudder,
and I tell you I don't want to see any place
that he is afraid of."</p>

<p>The two friends continued to talk in this way
until Captain Clinton's cook came up and told
George that dinner was ready. They rested half
an hour after the meal was over, and then set out
again, Mountain Mose leading the way and Mr.
Wentworth, as before, riding by himself. As
George was a sort of supernumerary, he was under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
little restraint, and consequently he rode where he
pleased&mdash;sometimes in company with the scout,
sometimes beside Captain Clinton, and then fell
back to exchange a few ideas with Bob. He did
not, however, waste much time with the scout.
The latter was talkative enough until he learned
that George held the same position that he did,
and then he froze up at once.</p>

<p>"You're a pretty-looking scout, <i>you</i> be!" he exclaimed,
moving his eye over the boy's trim figure.
"Do you reckon you could tell the trail of
a Kiowa from the track of a coyote?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I reckon I could," answered George with
a smile. "But you need not be jealous of me, for
I shall not interfere with you in any way. I came
to the post to hunt Greasers, and not to trail Indians."</p>

<p>"Oh, you did, eh? So you're the chap that's
goin' to show the boys the way acrost the Rio, be
you?"</p>

<p>"I am," replied George.</p>

<p>"Well, all I've got to say is, that them that
follers you is fools. I thought mebbe you was
agoin' to poke your nose into my business; and
that is something I won't put up with from no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>body.
If thar's anything I <i>do</i> understand, it's
Indians."</p>

<p>This was true, but it sometimes happens that luck
is not on the side of those who know the most.
The scout would have given anything he possessed
if he had been fortunate enough to perform the exploit
that George assisted in performing before
two days more had passed over his head.</p>

<p>Bob Owens did not fail to notice that there was
not the least semblance of a trail to be seen anywhere.
They had left it at the ruins of Mr.
Wentworth's rancho, and he waited with no little
impatience to see where they would pick it up
again. He found out about sunset, for at that
time the column reached the banks of a small
water-course, and there they struck the trail, which
was so broad and plain that it could be followed
at a gallop. George, in company with some of the
officers and the scout, spent a few minutes in looking
it over, and then rode back to report the result
of his observations to Bob Owens.</p>

<p>"There are not many warriors in the party,"
said he, "but they are so well supplied with horses
that they can have a fresh mount every day if
they want it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>"How do you know that?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"Because I saw their tracks," replied George.</p>

<p>"That's not explicit enough. I suppose you
did see the tracks of the horses, and so did I; but
how in the world is a fellow going to tell whether
or not those horses had riders on their backs?
<i>That's</i> something that can't be done."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure of that. Look here! Would
you believe it if I should tell you that those Indians
passed along here after daylight on Thursday
morning?"</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't," replied Bob bluntly. He
could not, for the life of him, understand how
anybody could draw such conclusions as these by
simply looking at the print of a pony's hoofs in
the grass; and if he had not been so well acquainted
with George he would have inclined to the belief
that his friend was "spreading it on" in order
to make himself out a wonderful trailer. "I can't
make head or tail of this business, and I don't
believe you can, either; that is, I mean I don't
see how you can."</p>

<p>"Well, listen while I explain," said George
good-naturedly. "In the first place, I noticed,
while we were passing through that belt of post-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>oaks
back there, that some of the horses left a very
devious trail, passing through thick bushes and under
trees whose branches were so low that they would
have swept a rider out of his saddle if he had not
been on the alert to avoid them. Those horses were
all loose."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," exclaimed Bob. "The Indians
might have passed through there when it was too
dark to see where they were going."</p>

<p>"I know they might, but they didn't, as I shall
presently show you. The horses which made those
crooked trails were not mustangs. They were
American horses, and their presence proves another
thing that I didn't think to speak of before; and
that is, that the Indians raided other ranches besides
Mr. Wentworth's. How do I know that they
were American horses? Because their tracks were
larger than a pony's, and some of them were shod.
The tracks made by the mustangs led through the
open part of the timber, where there were no bushes
and low branches; and this is one proof that the Indians
did not pass through there in the night-time.
If they had, they could not have kept in such open
ground. I found further proof that these mustangs
were all mounted by noticing that they did not stop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
to graze, as the loose horses did, being kept in constant
motion by their riders. What do you think
now?" asked George, seeing that Bob began to open
his eyes.</p>

<p>"It reads like a book, don't it?" was Bob's reply.
"But you have forgotten one very important thing.
You said that the Indians passed through those post-oaks
early on Thursday morning. How do you know
that they didn't pass late on Thursday afternoon or
early on Friday morning?"</p>

<p>"You think you have got me there, don't you?
Well, you haven't. If there are 'sermons in stones
and books in running brooks,' as the poet tells us
there are, what is the reason that the print of an Indian
pony's hoof may not contain a page of information
that will prove to be useful to him who has
the skill to read it? On Wednesday night there was
a very heavy dew, if you remember."</p>

<p>"I don't remember," replied Bob; "I never pay
any attention to such things."</p>

<p>"But you must pay attention to such things, and
a good deal of it too, if you are going to be a Plainsman.
During the last two nights there has been no
dew at all. I noticed that some blades of grass,
which had been pressed down by the hoofs of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
horses and cattle, were covered with sand which
stuck fast to them, having been dried on. This
told me that the tracks were made while the grass
was wet, and that the Indians had passed that way
early on Thursday morning, or before the sun had
risen high enough to dry off the dew. There were
not more than fifteen or twenty of them. I didn't
have time to see just how many, but they have
stolen over a thousand head of steers and horses.
Now, remember all I have told you, and see if I
haven't made a pretty good guess."</p>

<p>"Do you think we shall catch them?" asked
Bob.</p>

<p>"Well," answered George slowly, "raiding Indians
<i>have</i> been overtaken and neatly whipped before
now, but I have always believed that it was
more by good luck than good management. These
fellows will begin to show their tactics as soon as
they find out that they are pursued. Then they
will probably leave behind a few of the best mounted
of the band to attract our attention and lead us
away from the others, who will make all haste to
take the prisoners and the stolon stock to a place
of safety. If we bite at that bait, we shall lose
everything, for as soon as the decoys have led us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
as far out of our way as they care to have us go,
they will disappear all of a sudden, and we shall
never see them again. If we keep on after the
main body, and travel fast enough to gain on them,
they will drop the stock in the desert, break up into
squads of twos and threes, and we shall have nothing
to do but to turn about and go home again."</p>

<p>The Indians did manoeuvre pretty nearly as George
said they would, but Captain Clinton and his scouting-party
did not go back to the fort until they

<h3>HOW GEORGE SAVED THE CAMP.</h3>


<p>The troopers went into camp about midnight,
having been nineteen hours in the saddle,
during which time they had marched more than
seventy miles. They halted on the bank of a
small stream near a ford over which the Indians
had passed during their retreat. The trail was
plain, and some of the troopers, who did not know
quite as much about trailing as they thought they
did, declared that they were close upon the heels
of the raiders.</p>

<p>"How is that, George?" asked Bob Owens, who
had been detailed as one of the corporals of the
guard. "Some of the boys say that if we should
follow the Indians for an hour or two longer we
would be within sight of their camp-fires."</p>

<p>"What makes them think so?" asked George.</p>

<p>"Because they have found tracks with the sand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
still running into them. Is that one of the signs
by which to tell the age of a trail?"</p>

<p>"Under some circumstances, yes; in the present
case, no. You could tell the age of a trail in that
way if the ground around it had not been disturbed.
This country about here is all quicksand, and
you can take your stand almost anywhere along the
banks of this stream, and by jumping up and down
shake the ground for ten feet on all sides of you.
When our heavy column crossed the ford and
climbed this bank, it shook the earth, and that
was what set the sand to running down into the
tracks."</p>

<p>"I declare!" exclaimed Bob, gazing admiringly
at his friend; "is there anything a trailer isn't
obliged to know?"</p>

<p>"If he wants to be an expert he must keep his
eyes and ears wide open, and pay strict attention
to little things which almost anybody else would
consider to be beneath his notice. It is wonderful
what proficiency a person who has a talent for such
things can acquire by practice. For example, this
scout of ours could learn more about a trail in two
minutes than I could in an hour. But he is fearfully
jealous," added George with a laugh, "and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
you ought to have seen how mad I made him while
we were passing through that belt of post-oaks this
afternoon. Seeing that Captain Clinton was waiting
very impatiently for information, I volunteered
the statement that the hostiles had passed that way
early on Thursday morning, and that Mr. Wentworth
was not the only one who had suffered at
their hands. The captain asked Mose what he
thought of that, and Mose replied, 'I think jest
this here, cap: if that kid is agoin' to lead this
yere party he had better say so, an' I will go back
to the post. He's a'most too fresh, an' he'd better
go back in the woods an' practise at holdin' his
chin.' But he did not contradict my statement,
and that was all the evidence I needed to prove
that I was right in what I said. The tracks here
on the bank are not as fresh as you suppose. If
they were wet, it would be a sign that the Indians
crossed the ford since three o'clock this
afternoon."</p>

<p>"Why since three o'clock?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"Because the sun went under a cloud at that
hour, and hasn't showed himself since to dry off
the water that the horses and cattle brought out
of the stream on their feet and legs."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>While the two boys were talking in this way
George was getting ready to go to bed. The camp
was located at the foot of a perpendicular bluff
which was perhaps twenty feet in height. On the
top of this bluff the horses were picketed, and beyond
them were the sentinels who were to look out
for the safety of the animals and keep guard over
their slumbering companions. Everything outside
of the circle of light made by the camp-fires was
concealed by the most intense darkness. Not even
a star twinkled in the sky. George spread his
blankets in a sheltered nook at the foot of the
bluff and courted the "drowsy god" in vain.
He was tired and his eyes were heavy, but he
could not go to sleep. After rolling and tossing
about for nearly two hours, he became too nervous
to remain inactive any longer, so he slung his rifle
on his back and climbed to the top of the bluff,
where he found Bob Owens and two other non-commissioned
officers sitting beside a fire and conversing
in low tones. At another fire a short distance
away sat Lieutenant Earle, the officer of the
guard, nodding over his pipe.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" exclaimed Bob, "what brought you
out here?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I want somebody to talk to," replied
George, throwing himself on the ground by his
friend's side, "Somehow, I can't sleep, and that's
a new thing for me."</p>

<p>"You are not afraid of the hostiles, are you?"
asked a corporal from the other side of the fire.</p>

<p>"Oh no, because I know that we have nothing to
fear from them on such a night as this. If there
were any hostiles in the neighborhood, they might
slip up and steal a few horses, if they thought they
could get away with their booty, but they wouldn't
attack a party of the size of ours and bring on an
open fight. It is too dark."</p>

<p>"Why, that is just the reason they <i>would</i> attack
us," exclaimed the corporal, who, although he had
often been on a scout, had never participated in a
battle. "They rely upon the darkness to cover
their movements and to assist them in effecting a
surprise. I have read it a hundred times."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," replied George&mdash;"story-book Indians
make attacks at all hours of the day and night, but
live Plains Indians don't. The reason for it is
this: They believe that they will go into the happy
hunting-grounds with just the same surroundings
that attend their departure from this world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
If an Indian is crippled or blind or ill, he will be
just the same Indian in the spirit-land. If he
dies from the effects of disease, he will suffer from
that disease for ever; but if he is killed in battle
on a pleasant day, and while he is in the possession
of all his strength and faculties, he will go straight
to the Indian's heaven under the most favorable
circumstances."</p>

<p>"Suppose he is killed on a rainy day?" said the
corporal on the other side of the fire.</p>

<p>"Or a snowy one?" chimed in a sergeant.</p>

<p>"Then he is doomed to paddle through rain or
snow through all eternity," replied George; "and
that he doesn't like either is proved by the fact
that he will not stir out of camp while it is raining
or snowing if he can help it. If an Indian is hanged,
like Captain Jack or those thirty-seven warriors
who were executed at Mankato in 1863 for participation
in the Sioux massacre, he loses all chance
of ever seeing the happy hunting-grounds. So he
does if he is scalped; and that's the reason Indians
make such efforts to carry off the body of a fallen
comrade. A Plains Indian never willingly goes
into a fight during the night. If he did, he would
make it much warmer for us here on the frontier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
than he does now. He may make use of a night
like this to get into position for an attack, but if
left to himself he will not raise the war-whoop before
daylight, because he believes that if he is killed
during the dark he will be condemned to pass
all eternity in darkness."</p>

<p>"Well, that is something I never knew before,"
said the corporal, "and I have been on the Plains
a good many years. Now that I think of it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Corporal of the guard, No. 7!" came the call
through the dense darkness, whereupon Bob Owens
jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble out there, I wonder?"
said he.</p>

<p>"Go and see," replied the sergeant with a sleepy
yawn: "that's the only way to find out."</p>

<p>"Sergeant," said the officer of the guard, "if
those horses have had grass enough, have them
brought in and tied to the stable-lines. Look well
to their fastenings."</p>

<p>"Corporal of the guard, No. 7!" came the call
again; and this time it was uttered in a louder and
more earnest tone.</p>

<p>Bob, who was walking toward post No. 7 with
a very deliberate step, now broke into a run, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
George jumped up and followed him. A fortunate
thing it was for that camp and its inmates that he
did so. His thorough acquaintance with the ways
of some of the inhabitants of the Plains enabled
him to prevent a catastrophe which would certainly
have resulted in a serious loss of life, and brought
Captain Clinton's scout to an inglorious end then
and there. When he and the corporal reached post
No. 7 they found the sentry on duty there lying
flat on his stomach and gazing earnestly toward
the horizon.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Sprague?" demanded Bob.</p>

<p>"I don't know, I am sure," replied the sentry.
"If the hostiles had made up their minds to pay
us a visit, they wouldn't make such a racket as that,
would they? There! don't you hear it? Something's
coming this way, I tell you, and coming on
a keen jump, too."</p>

<p>The three held their breath and listened intently.
A second later the breeze brought to their ears the
sound that had attracted the attention of the sentry&mdash;a
deep, rumbling sound, faint and far off, but increasing
perceptibly in volume. It resembled the
constant muttering of distant thunder, but they all
knew it was not that. Bob's face brightened at once,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
but George's grew pale. The corporal did not know
the danger that threatened them, but his companion
did; he had heard something like it before. He
had heard it on the night that Fletcher and his band
of raiders stampeded his stock, and he had thrown
himself into an old buffalo-wallow and allowed
three hundred frantic cattle to gallop over his
head.</p>

<p>"Why, it must be cavalry from Fort Tyler,"
said Bob at length.&mdash;"But I'll tell you what's a
fact, boys," he added, as a fresh gust of wind
brought the sound more plainly to his ears: "there
must be lots of them, for I never heard such a roar
of hoofs before. They are coming this way, too.
I hope they'll not run over us."</p>

<p>"Well, they <i>will</i> run over us," said George,
speaking quickly but calmly, "unless you take
immediate steps to prevent it. They are not
cavalry; they are buffaloes."</p>

<p>"Oh! ah!" exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>"Humph!" ejaculated the sentry, jumping to
his feet.&mdash;"Don't tell the boys what I called you
out for, will you, corporal? To tell the truth, I
was just a little bit&mdash;"</p>

<p>He finished the sentence by shrugging his shoul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>ders,
and Bob, who knew what he meant by that,
was about to assure him that he would say nothing
in the hearing of the "boys" that would enable
them to "get the laugh" on him, when George
Ackerman broke in with&mdash;</p>

<p>"You had good reason to be alarmed, and this
is not a matter to be dropped with an 'ah!' and an
'oh!' and a 'humph!' You are in great danger,
if you only knew it. Those buffaloes are stampeded,
and will not stop until they are all out of
breath."</p>

<p>"Well, if they don't want to stop, let them run,"
said Bob. "Who cares? They don't owe us anything.
They will of course turn aside when they
see us."</p>

<p>"But they will not see you unless you do something
to attract their attention," exclaimed George
impatiently. "They will be in among us in five
minutes more, and men and horses will be trampled
into the ground like blades of grass. Wake up and
do something, can't you? The safety of the camp
depends upon you, and if you don't move, I will."</p>

<p>"Great Moses!" ejaculated Bob. He was thoroughly
aroused by the earnest words of his companion,
but having never been placed in a situation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
like this before, he did not know how to act. "You
don't mean that&mdash;I never heard of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do mean that they will trample the whole
camp to death unless you prevent it; and I don't
care whether you ever heard of such a thing being
done or not," cried George, seizing the corporal by
the arm and shaking him as if he wanted to put
a little energy into him.</p>

<p>"But what shall I do? Shall I order up the
reserve and get the horses out of the way?"</p>

<p>"You haven't got time to get them out of the
way. The buffaloes will be upon us before you
could take half a dozen of them to a place of safety.
Arouse the camp the first thing, and then call
up a few good men to go out and split the herd the
moment it comes in sight."</p>

<p>Bob, who was still in the dark, was about to ask
how he should go to work to "split" the herd after
he had selected the men, but George did not give
him the opportunity. The rumbling of the approaching
hoofs grew louder and louder, and every
moment was precious. It sounded before them and
to the right and left of them, indicating that the
herd was an immense one, and that it was advancing
with a front broad enough to overwhelm the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
entire camp. Knowing that no more time could
be wasted in debating the matter, George unslung
his Winchester and fired two shots into the air.
The effect was almost magical. The camp, which
had been so quiet a second before, was aroused into
instant life and activity. Loud cries of "Indians!"
and " Fall in!" arose on the still air, followed by
blasts from the bugle and stern notes of command.
The officer of the guard was promptly on the ground,
and to him Bob reported that a herd of stampeded
buffaloes was bearing down upon them. The announcement
startled the lieutenant, but he acted with
the greatest coolness. As fast as the men came up
he ordered them back to take care of the horses&mdash;all
except a dozen or so of the best soldiers known
to him, whom he ordered to follow him. By the
time he had taken up his position, which was on a
little rise of ground about fifty yards from post No.
7, Captain Clinton came up. Taking in at a glance
the arrangements which his subordinate had made
to avert the terrible danger that threatened the camp,
he left him and his picked men to carry out those
arrangements or perish in the attempt, while he
hastened back to see that the horses were well
secured.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>"Steady!" commanded Lieutenant Earle, speaking
in his loudest tones, in order to make his voice
heard above the roar of the threatening hoofs, which
sounded like the noise made by an approaching
hurricane. "We are here to conquer or die. If
we don't split that herd they will trample us out
of sight in the ground. We can do it if we are
only cool enough to hold our position. Don't fire
until I give the word, and then put in the shots
as rapidly as you know how."</p>

<p>Bob's hair fairly stood on end, and not even the
calm bearing of George Ackerman, who was constantly
by his side and who knew their danger better
than he did, or the lieutenant's assurance that
the herd could be split if they did their full duty,
could relieve Bob's mind of the positive conviction
that he and his comrades were doomed to certain
and speedy death. But his courage never faltered,
and to show that he did not intend to allow himself
to be outdone in steadiness even by a shoulder-strap,
he walked up and kneeling beside his officer
(the men in the front rank were all kneeling, so
that those in the rear rank could shoot over their
heads) waited for the order to fire.</p>

<p>Nearer came the terror-stricken buffaloes, louder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
grew the thunder of their hoofs, and, as if to add
to the horror of the situation and to test the courage
of the lieutenant and his devoted little band to
the very utmost, the horses behind them began to
grow unmanageable from fright and to struggle
desperately to escape from their fastenings.</p>

<p>At length, after a few moments of dreadful suspense,
the time for action arrived. A rapidly-moving
mass, which was plainly visible, owing to
the fact that it was blacker than the darkness of
the night, burst into view and bore down upon the
camp and its little band of defenders. So loud
was the noise made by their hoofs at this moment
that the troopers did not hear the order to fire,
which the lieutenant shouted out with all the power
of his lungs; but they saw the flash of his revolver,
and lost no time in opening a hot fire upon
that portion of the herd which was directly in
front of them. To Bob it seemed that the rapid
discharges of their breech-loaders had no effect
whatever. The black mass before him was as
black and as dense, apparently, as it was when he
first saw it, but, strange to say, instead of plunging
upon him and his companions and trampling
them out of all semblance to humanity, it seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
to remain stationary, although the deafening roar of
those countless hoofs told him that the frantic herd
had not in the least slackened its pace. In fact,
his eyes and ears seemed to have suddenly become
at "outs," for they did not endorse each other as
they usually did. His eyes told him that his carbine
was fired rapidly, for they showed him the
flashes that followed the pulling of the trigger;
but his ears took no note of the fact, for he could
not hear the faintest report. The reason for this
was, that the herd, having been split in two by the
first volley, was moving by on each side of them
with a roar and a rush that would have drowned
the discharge of a section of artillery.</p>

<p>How long the buffaloes were in passing Bob
never knew, for he took no note of time. It was
probably not more than two or three minutes, but
during that brief period he passed through an ordeal
that he never could think of afterward without
feeling the cold chills creep all over him. But
he did not flinch, and neither did his companions.
When the last of the buffaloes passed to the right
and left of them, and the lieutenant jumped up
and stretched his arms and legs as if to assure
himself that he had not been stepped on anywhere,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
he found that not one of his men had moved from
his place. The front rank was still kneeling, the
rear rank was standing, and they were both as well
aligned as they were before the firing commenced.</p>

<p>After ordering the front rank to rise, and bestowing
upon them all a few hearty words of commendation,
the lieutenant marched his men back to
the camp, where they found some of their companions
under arms, and the rest engaged in bringing
in the horses and making them fast to the stable-lines.
The animals were in such a state of alarm,
and showed so strong a desire to run off with the
retreating buffaloes, that Captain Clinton thought
it advisable to put a strong guard over them for
the rest of the night, with instructions to examine
their fastenings every few minutes. When this
guard had been detailed and the sentries had been
changed, the rest of the troopers went back to
their blankets.</p>

<p>Bob and George were proud of the part they had
acted in saving the camp from destruction, and consequently
when they spread their blankets beside
one of the fires they were somewhat provoked to
hear the man who was piling fresh fuel upon it
attribute their narrow escape to "luck." But still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
there was nothing very surprising in this, for it not
infrequently happens that a soldier stationed in one
end of a camp does not know what is going on in
the other end of it, especially in times of excitement.
The same thing happens in a fight. A
soldier may be able to give a clear statement of the
part his company took in it, but he knows nothing
of the general plan of the battle or of the number
of the killed, wounded, captured or missing, until
he has had time to talk the matter over with his
comrades or to read a published account of it.
During the war it was a common saying among
the soldiers in the field that they never knew anything
about the fights they had been in until they
saw the papers.</p>

<p>"I have been on the Plains nearly three years,"
said the trooper who was punching up the fire, "and
that was the first time I ever saw a herd of stampeded
buffaloes."</p>

<p>"I never saw one," said another trooper. "I
heard this one, but my horse kept me so busy that
I couldn't take time to look at it."</p>

<p>"I had a fair view of it," said the one who had
first spoken. "My horse was quiet enough after
I got the bit between his teeth, so that I could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
manage him, and I stood up there by that farther
fire and took it all in. I tell you, it was a sight!&mdash;a
regular cataract of buffaloes a hundred feet wide,
tumbling over a bank twenty feet high. I have
always heard that when buffaloes become frightened
and get to running they turn aside for nothing; but
this night's experience gives the lie to all such
stories, don't it? When they saw our camp they
turned to the right and left, and crossed the stream
above and below us, and never did us the least
damage. Luck was on our side, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"'Luck'!" repeated Bob in a tone of disgust;
"I guess not. There were about a dozen men, of
whom George Ackerman and I made two, who
stood between you fellows and certain death. If
we hadn't held our ground as if we had grown
there, there wouldn't have been one of you left
to tell the story of this night's work."</p>

<p>The troopers lying about the fire were greatly
astonished at these words, and called for an immediate
explanation. Bob told the story in a few
words, adding, as he directed the attention of his
auditors to George Ackerman, who was lying at
his ease on his blanket,</p>

<p>"There's the fellow you have to thank for your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
'luck.' Sprague heard them coming, and so did
I after he called me out to his post, but we didn't
know what it was until Ackerman told us. He was
the one who alarmed the camp. I know I did something
toward splitting that herd, for I could see the
fire come out of my carbine and my cartridge-box
is empty, but I never heard a report. I didn't hear
anything but the thunder of those hoofs, and I shall
hear it to my dying day."</p>

<p>"I wonder what started them?" said one of the
troopers, after he and his companions had asked a
few questions concerning the behavior of the various
members of the squad. "Indians?"</p>

<p>"Probably they did," answered a sergeant, who
just then came up to the fire to light his pipe,
being unable to go to sleep until he had taken a
smoke to quiet his nerves.</p>

<p>"Probably the Indians had nothing to do with
it," said George. "Don't you know that a herd of
buffaloes will feed within a mile or two of an Indian
camp for days at a time, while half a dozen white
men would scare them out of the country in less
than an hour? Well, it's a fact."</p>

<p>"What is the reason for it?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"The reason is to be found in the different modes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
of hunting them. The Indian, who depends largely
upon them for food and clothing, kills no more
of them during a run than the squaws can take care
of. He hunts them almost altogether with the bow
and arrow, which are not only very effective weapons
at short range, but they make no noise to scare
away the game. He hunts according to long-established
rules, none but the best men in the tribe being
permitted to take part in a run, and in this way the
game is secured before the buffaloes get frightened
enough to break into a stampede. The white man,
who hunts principally for profit, keeps up the killing
as long as he can hold the herd within range of
his gun. He follows them persistently during the
daytime, and at night lies in wait to shoot them as
they come to the streams to quench their thirst. A
buffalo is a very stupid animal, but, after all, it
doesn't take him long to get some things through
his head."</p>

<p>"Fresh, purty <i>fresh</i>!" murmured a voice.</p>

<p>George looked over his shoulders and saw the
scout lying close by on his blanket. He had come
up to the fire and arranged his bed without attracting
the attention of any one.</p>

<p>"Do you think there is nobody in this party<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
who knows anything except yourself?" demanded
George.</p>

<p>"Well, no; judgin' by the way you sling your
chin, you know it all," replied the scout.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose first put this herd in
motion?" asked one of the troopers, who had not
yet gained all the information he wanted.</p>

<p>"That's a question that nobody can answer unless
he was on the ground and saw them start," answered
George.&mdash;"You'll not dispute that, will you,
Mose?&mdash;Our Texas cattle will often get stampeded
by the sight of a little cloud of dust that is suddenly
raised by the wind; or some night a careless
herdsman may step between them and the fire and
throw his shadow upon them; or some of the young
and foolish members of a drove will fall to skylarking,
and that will frighten the others, and the first
thing you know they are all off like the wind.
Buffaloes have just as little sense. My herdsman
has told me that he has seen hundreds of them,
when they were suffering for water, walk into a
stream that was literally choked with the bodies
of their companions who had been caught in the
quicksand."</p>

<p>"Say," growled a drowsy trooper from his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
blanket, "suppose you boys go somewhere and
hire a hall?"</p>

<p>George laughed, and, taking the hint thus delicately
thrown out, brought his lecture on buffaloes
to a close. The remembrance of the thrilling
scene through which he had just passed did not
keep him awake. On the contrary, sleep came to
his eyes almost immediately, and the last sound he
heard as he was about to pass into the land of
dreams was the subdued voice of the scout murmuring,
"Fresh, very fresh!"</p>

<h3>TELEGRAPHING BY SMOKES.</h3>


<p>The camp was aroused at an early hour the
next morning, and by the time it was fairly
daylight breakfast had been disposed of and the
column was again in motion. The firing-squad
had brought down a goodly number of buffaloes
in their efforts to split the herd&mdash;enough to furnish
the whole camp with a hearty meal and to enable
each trooper to carry two days' cooked rations in
his haversack. During the first few miles of their
march there was no trail for them to follow, all
traces of the thieving Kiowas having been obliterated
by the hoofs of the stampeded buffaloes; but
this did not interfere with the movements of the
scout, who, from the start, led the way at a rapid
pace. He knew the general direction in which the
trail led, and that was enough for him.</p>

<p>"Where do you think we shall pick it up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
again?" asked Captain Clinton of George, who
rode by his side.</p>

<p>"Do you see that butte?" asked George in reply,
directing the officer's attention to a single high
peak in the distance, which marked the south-eastern
boundary of the dreaded Staked Plains. "We
shall not see another drop of water until we reach
that mountain, and we shall find some traces of the
Indians there, if we do not find them before."</p>

<p>"Purty fresh!" exclaimed the scout, who had
overheard every word of this conversation.</p>

<p>"Well, if you know better, why don't you say
so?" demanded George. "Every prediction I have
made so far has turned out to be correct. Now,
see how far I miss it when I tell you that the Indians
camped beside that butte last night."</p>

<p>"Then we are gaining on them?" said the
captain.</p>

<p>"We are," was the boy's confident reply. "And
for the reason that we have followed a direct course
and ridden rapidly, while the Indians took a roundabout
way and moved slowly, being hampered by
their stolen cattle."</p>

<p>George's calculations proved to be correct. About
three o'clock in the afternoon they again took up the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
trail, and followed it at a gallop. They reached the
peak just before dark, and found abundant evidence
that the Indians had recently camped there. The
troopers halted here too to get a little rest and a
wink of sleep, but at nine o'clock they were once
more on the move. The next halt was made about
two in the morning, and at daylight they were again
in their saddles and riding ahead as rapidly as ever.
The trail led them along the borders of the Staked
Plains, giving some of the troopers, who had never
before scouted so far in this direction, their first view
of that desolate region. A gloomy-looking place it
was. As far as their eyes could reach they could
see nothing but sandhills, with stunted weeds and
clumps of grass which seemed to be struggling
hard to maintain a foothold in the arid soil.</p>

<p>They had marched perhaps ten miles from
their last camp when George Ackerman, who was
riding by Captain Clinton's side, discovered something.
He looked at it for a moment, and then
called the officer's attention to it.</p>

<p>"They have begun their tricks at last," said he.
"Do you see that dark streak out there in the grass?
That's a new trail. There! Mose has discovered it,
and is going out to see what it looks like."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>Bringing the column to a halt, the captain, accompanied
by George and some of the officers, rode
forward to the place where the scout, who had got
down from his horse, stood bending over the trail.
After he had taken plenty of time in which to make
his investigations, he straightened up to announce
the result.</p>

<p>"Four of them varmints has gone this way, cap,"
said he. "They've left a plain trail, on purpose to
coax you to foller 'em."</p>

<p>"They shall be gratified," answered the captain
promptly. "As my party is larger than theirs, I
can stand more divisions than they can. I would
as soon whip them in detail as to whip them in a
lump.&mdash;Earle, take a dozen men from your troop
and follow it up."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," replied the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Have you brought your signal-code with you?
All right! If you discover anything startling, send
a courier to me with the fullest details. I will follow
along after the main body. Be cautious, but
at the same time keep moving, for we ought to be
within striking distance of those rascals in a few
hours more."</p>

<p>The lieutenant saluted and rode back to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
column, drawing his sword as he went. Dropping
the weapon behind the third column of fours, he
gave the order. "The first three fours, right by
twos&mdash;march! Column left&mdash;march!"</p>

<p>This brought the selected twelve alongside the
new trail, which they at once began to follow up
at a gallop, waving their caps to their comrades as
they rode away. By selecting his men in this way
the lieutenant did not happen to take Bob Owens,
who rode farther back in the column. The young
soldier, who was not in the habit of being slighted
when there was anything of this kind going on, was
both surprised and provoked at his officer; but he
afterward thanked him for choosing his men as he
did, and congratulated himself on having been left
behind. Mr. Wentworth gazed longingly after the
lieutenant, and sometimes seemed on the point of
riding in pursuit of him; but he finally made up
his mind to stay with the main column.</p>

<p>The troopers presently resumed the march, keeping
up the same rapid pace as before, and in a few
minutes lost sight of Lieutenant Earle and his party,
who disappeared among the sandhills. The latter
must have ridden very swiftly, for shortly after
noon they were a long distance from the main<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
body, their position being pointed out by a slender
column of white smoke that suddenly arose in the
air.</p>

<p>"That's them varmints, cap," said the scout,
whose eye was quick to detect the signal. "They're
talkin' to each other."</p>

<p>"I know there is somebody where that smoke
comes from, but I am not sure that they are hostiles,"
replied Captain Clinton. "On the contrary,
I am of the opinion that the men who built that
fire want to talk to <i>me</i>. At any rate, I shall soon
know."</p>

<p>As the captain said this he pulled his watch from
his pocket with one hand, and with the other produced
a note-book, which he held ready for reference.
The column was not halted, but the eye of
every man in it was fastened upon the distant smoke.
When it had ascended to such a height that its top
seemed lost in the clouds, it was suddenly cut loose
from the ground by some mysterious agency, and
floated off into space. A few seconds passed, and
then two balloon-shaped clouds arose in quick succession
from the same spot, and George took note
of the fact that when the last one arose the captain
looked at his watch. Another short interval elapsed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
and then two more clouds arose, and finally two
more; whereupon the captain gave his knee a ringing
slap and consulted his note-book.</p>

<p>"I knew I couldn't be mistaken," said he.
"That's from Earle, and he is about to communicate
with me by courier.&mdash;Push ahead now, scout,
for he is on a hot trail. Hallo! have you found
another?" he added as the scout, instead of obeying
the order to "push ahead," suddenly drew up
his horse and threw himself from his saddle.
"How many have gone off this time?"</p>

<p>"The same number," answered the scout, "an'
they were goin' somewhar too, for their ponies
were movin' at full jump when they turned off
here. They're up to some trick or another, but I
can't tell yet what it is."</p>

<p>"Then we must find out, for it is our business
to look into these little things. I should like to
know where this trail leads to, and I want&mdash;Let
me see."</p>

<p>The captain turned about and ran his eye over
the column, which came to a halt as soon as the
commanding officer was seen to stop his horse. He
seemed to be in a quandary, out of which he was
helped almost immediately by the sight of a sol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>dierly
figure upon which his gaze rested for a
moment.</p>

<p>"He's the man I want," said the captain aloud.&mdash;"Ackerman,
will you tell Lieutenant Smith, who
is now in command of Earle's troop, that I want
to see Corporal Owens?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir. May I go with him?" replied
George, who knew in a moment that there was
something in the wind.</p>

<p>The captain nodded assent, and George galloped
back to the column. When he returned Bob
Owens rode at his side. The captain was writing&mdash;copying
something upon a piece of paper
from his note-book&mdash;but he stopped long enough
to return Bob's salute, although he did not say anything
to him. Seeing that the officer's horse was
growing restive at the delay, and that by his constant
pawing and tossing of his head he disturbed
his rider, who did his writing while seated in the
saddle, Bob dismounted and took the animal by
the bridle, and the troopers who remained in column
seized the opportunity to fill and light their
pipes.</p>

<p>"There!" said the captain at length.&mdash;"Step up
here, corporal, and I will explain this to you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>&mdash;Ackerman,
tell Lieutenant Smith to pick out
twelve good men to follow this new trail."</p>

<p>By the time the lieutenant had received and
obeyed this order, Captain Clinton, who was a fast
talker, had told the corporal just what he wanted
him to do, and explained to him the contents of
the paper he had copied from his note-book; and
Bob, who was quick to comprehend, had caught and
weighed all his words as fast as they were uttered.
He then put himself at the head of his men and
led them away, George Ackerman riding by his
side.</p>

<p>"Now we are off for another lark," exclaimed
Carey as soon as he and his companions had
left the column out of hearing. By some chance,
he and Loring and Phillips had been selected to
accompany Bob on every one of his expeditions,
and as they had never failed to accomplish the
object for which they were sent out, they began to
think that there was nothing too hard for them to
undertake.</p>

<p>"But this may not be so much of a 'lark' as
you think," said Bob; and Carey afterward recalled
the words when he found himself debarred
from accompanying other scouting-parties on ac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>count
of a painful wound in his sword-arm. "We
are not out after deserters now, but Indians."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with them if you
find them?" asked Loring.</p>

<p>"I shall make things as lively for them as I
can," replied Bob. "But I don't think I shall
come up with them; and the captain doesn't expect
me to. He is going to follow every trail and force
the Indians to go back to their agency, whether
they want to go or not; that is, unless we can
overhaul them before they get there."</p>

<p>"I <i>know</i> we are not out on a 'lark,'" said
George Ackerman. "What would you say if we
had to go into camp to-night without water?"</p>

<p>"Gracious!" exclaimed Phillips, looking around
at the sandhills, which now shut them in on all
sides. "The prospect of finding a stream or a
spring is not very flattering, is it? I wish we
could find one now, for the water in my canteen
is just ready to boil."</p>

<p>"You had better be careful of it," said George,
"for it is much better than none at all."</p>

<p>"Is there any water to be found in this country?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes; and this trail will take us to it by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
shortest route. An Indian can't live without water
any more than we can, and he knows just where
to find it."</p>

<p>"Say, George," exclaimed Bob suddenly, "didn't
I hear Mose say that when the four horses that made
this trail turned off the <i>big</i> trail, they were going at
full speed?"</p>

<p>George replied that he did say so.</p>

<p>"How did he know it?" continued Bob.</p>

<p>"By the looks of the tracks and the distance between
them. When a horse is walking his hind foot
covers about half the print made by his fore foot,
and the tracks are from two and a half to three feet
apart. When the horse is trotting the tracks are not
so distinct, the one made by the fore foot being nearly
covered up, and they are from seven to eight feet
apart. When he is running the print of only one
foot can be seen, as a general thing the ground about
the tracks is considerably disturbed, and they are
from seven to twelve feet apart."</p>

<p>If Carey and the rest of the squad did not learn
to their entire satisfaction that they were not out on
a picnic this time, the horses on which they were
mounted certainly did, for before an hour had passed
they were very much in need of water&mdash;so much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
so that Bob brought them down to a trot, and at last
to a walk. At the end of another hour their riders
began to suffer in the same way, and it was not long
before every drop in their canteens, warm as it was,
had disappeared. Whether it was the parched appearance
of things around them; or the effects of
the wind, which came into their faces as hot as a
blast from a furnace; or the reflection of the sun's
rays from the sandhills around them; or the sand
itself, which arose in the air when disturbed by their
horses' hoofs, and settled in their mouths and nostrils,&mdash;whether
it was one or all of these causes combined
that made them so very thirsty they did not
think to inquire, but certain it was that they would
have welcomed the discovery of a water-course more
heartily now than at any other time during their
march. Just how long this state of affairs was to
continue they did not know, for there was not one
among them who could tell whether water was five
or twenty miles off. The only thing they could do
was to follow the trail and await the issue of events
with all the patience they could command.</p>

<p>After they had been separated from the main
column for about three hours, two incidents happened
which served to relieve the monotony of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
march, and caused them, for the time being, to forget
how uncomfortably hot and dusty and thirsty
they were. As they were riding silently along behind
George Ackerman, whose fast-walking nag had
carried him some distance in advance of the squad,
they saw him draw rein all of a sudden and raise
his hand with a warning gesture. Then he backed
his horse under cover of a convenient sandhill, and
pulling his field-glass from the case he carried slung
over his shoulder, he levelled it at some object that
had attracted his attention, but which could not be
seen by the troopers.</p>

<p>Bob at once ordered a halt, and rode forward to
inquire into the matter. When he reached George's
side he found himself on the outskirts of a sort of
basin in the plain, which looked as though it might
have been scooped out by the wind. It was covered
with sand, and dotted here and there with little
bunches of yellow grass and weeds. On the opposite
side of this basin, which was perhaps a mile and
a half wide, was a single horseman, who was riding
toward them at a rapid pace.</p>

<p>"I couldn't make out, at that distance, whether
he was a friend or foe, so I thought it best to warn
you," said George.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>"That was all right, of course. Can you make
him out with your glass?"</p>

<p>"Very plainly. He's a soldier&mdash;one of Lieutenant
Earle's men, probably."</p>

<p>"That's just who he is," exclaimed Bob after he
had taken a look at the horseman through the field-glass.
"I know him. That signal-smoke we saw
just before we left the column was sent up to inform
the captain that Earle had despatched a courier
to him with some important news, and now we will
find out what it is.&mdash;Come on, fellows," he added,
waving his hand to the squad; "it is one of our
own company, boys."</p>

<p>Bob and his companion rode out in plain view,
and a few seconds later the troopers joined them.
Their sudden appearance must have astonished the
approaching courier, and perhaps alarmed him too,
for he pulled up his horse with a jerk, and, shading
his eyes with his hand, gazed at them long and
earnestly. They waved their caps to reassure him,
and in a few minutes he came up. The first words
he uttered showed that he had already had quite
enough of scouting in the Staked Plains.</p>

<p>"Did anybody ever see so dreary a hole as
this?" said he as he lifted his cap and drew his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
handkerchief across his forehead&mdash;"nothing but
sandhills as far as you can see, and one looks so
much like another that a fellow don't know how
to shape a course. It must be just fearful in here
when the wind blows.&mdash;I say, corporal, where am
I? and what are you doing out here?"</p>

<p>"I can't answer your first question, for I don't
know myself," answered Bob. "I was sent out
to follow a new trail we found just after you sent
up that smoke. What was the meaning of it?&mdash;Carey,
climb up to the top of that sandhill and
tell us if you can see anything."</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Earle sent up that smoke to let the
captain know that he was about to send him some
news," replied the horseman; "and I don't see
why the captain didn't send up a reply, for I don't
know where to find him."</p>

<p>"I will point out his position as near as I can
before you leave us," said Bob. "Is that news of
any importance?"</p>

<p>"I should say it was," exclaimed the courier.
"We've struck it hot, I tell you. On the banks
of a little stream we found somewhere off in that
direction&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look here, Aleck!" exclaimed Loring; "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
thought that canteen of yours looked as though
it had been dipped in water not so <i>very</i> long ago.
Why don't you pass it around? We haven't got
a drop left."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" said the courier, who promptly
unslung his canteen. "You are welcome to it, but
touch it easy, so that everybody can have a taste,
and don't forget to save some for Carey.&mdash;As I
was saying, on the banks of that stream the scout
discovered the tracks of little boots."</p>

<p>The troopers all uttered exclamations when they
heard this, and Loring was so anxious to hear more
that he forgot he was thirsty, and after holding the
canteen in his hand for a moment passed it to a
comrade without tasting of its contents.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wentworth acted as though he thought
he ought to go with Lieutenant Earle's squad, and
when he hears that he will be sorry that he stayed
behind," observed Bob.</p>

<p>"Won't he, though!" said the courier.</p>

<p>"I suppose there is no doubt that the tracks
were made by his boys?" said George.</p>

<p>"None whatever. How could there be? The
Indians have no other prisoners with them."</p>

<p>"They have none that we know of," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
George. "But as they visited other ranches, they
may have taken other boys captive."</p>

<p>"How do you know that they did visit other
ranches?" demanded the courier. "Mr. Wentworth
didn't say anything about it in my hearing."</p>

<p>"Nor in mine, either," replied George. "But
he did say in my hearing that he had lost not more
than half a dozen horses, and the trail shows that
they have more than fifty with them."</p>

<p>"Well," said the courier, looking down at the
horn of his saddle in a brown study, "if that's the
case, the Indians may have&mdash;No, they didn't,
either," he added, brightening. "Mr. Wentworth
told the colonel, in Lieutenant Earle's hearing, that
the Indians jumped down on his ranche just after
he had finished mending his oldest boy's boots.
He put a patch on each one of them just under
the ball of the foot, and those patches showed in
the tracks."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed George, "that will pass for
evidence."</p>

<p>"At any rate," continued the courier, "I was
ordered to tell the captain that we were on the
trail of the party who had the children. That's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
all the news I have, I believe.&mdash;What shall I tell
the captain for you, corporal?"</p>

<p>"Say to him that you found me following up
my trail as fast as the condition of my horses
would permit," answered Bob. "It is as plain as
daylight, and if I could only get some water now
and then, I could follow it at a gallop.&mdash;What is
it, Carey?"</p>

<p>"A smoke away off to the south-east," replied
the soldier, who was lying flat on the top of the
nearest sandhill.</p>

<p>Bob at once dismounted and made his way up
the hill, followed by George and the courier. They
did not expose their full height to view, but crept
up on their hands and knees, and when they reached
the top pulled off their caps before they looked
over it. They knew that Indians, when they are
retreating, always leave some of their number to
watch the trail, and they adopted these precautions
in order to avoid discovery by these rear-guards
should there chance to be any in the neighborhood.
The reflection of the sun's rays from the brass ornaments
on their caps would have been seen by a
watchful Indian at an almost incredible distance.</p>

<p>"I see the smoke," said Bob, pulling from his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
pocket the paper which Captain Clinton had given
him&mdash;"Where is your watch, George? Now look
for the signal."</p>

<p>The smoke, like the one Lieutenant Earle had
sent up a few hours before, ascended in a straight,
slender column for a few seconds, and then floated
away out of sight. A few seconds later three little
columns, shaped like the clouds which are thrown
out by the discharge of a cannon, arose in the air
in quick succession, followed after a little delay by
three others. Bob waited and watched, but as no
more clouds appeared, he knew that the signal had
been made. The next thing was to find out what
it meant.</p>

<p>"George," said he, "after those first three smokes
appeared how long was it before the others were
seen?"</p>

<p>"Just thirty seconds," replied the time-keeper.</p>

<p>Bob ran his eye over the paper he held in his
hand, and presently found the following, which he
read aloud: "Three smokes, followed at the interval
of half a minute by three others, are intended
to point out the position of the signalling-party."&mdash;"There
you are!" said he, turning to the courier.
"Fix in your mind the place from which that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
smoke arose, and then travel a little to the north
of it, so as to allow for the captain's progress, and
you will find him."</p>

<p>"How far away was that smoke?" asked the
courier as he and his companions crept back down
the hill.</p>

<p>"Fifteen miles," replied George.</p>

<p>"Whew! Well, I'll get there if I can. Who's
got my canteen? Why, you have left some in it!"
he added as one of the squad handed him the article
in question. "Don't any of you want another
taste?"</p>

<p>Yes, there were plenty there who could have
drained the canteen to the last drop and then called
for more, but knowing that the courier would
have need of it before he had galloped fifteen miles
under that broiling sun with the hot wind blowing
upon him, they all declared that they had had
enough.</p>

<p>After Carey and Loring had moistened their
parched lips the courier sprang upon his horse
and waved his farewell, while Bob and his men,
feeling somewhat refreshed, took up the trail again
and followed it at a trot.</p>

<h3>ANOTHER FEATHER FOR BOB'S CAP.</h3>


<p>The second diversion of which we have spoken
occurred about an hour after Lieutenant Earle's
courier left them. It was nothing more nor less
than the discovery of the fact that the party of
whom they were in pursuit had been joined by
another warrior, whose pony's tracks came from
the direction in which the lieutenant was supposed
to be scouting. Bob and his men did not seem to
attach much importance to this, but George did. He
looked the ground over very carefully, and reached
conclusions that astonished himself.</p>

<p>"Bob Owens," said he in a low tone as they resumed
the march, "you've got another chance to put
a feather in your hat&mdash;a big one, too. Lieutenant
Earle will never rescue Mr. Wentworth's boys, but
you can if you're smart."</p>

<p>Bob, who always listened in the greatest amazement
(and with some incredulity, too, it must be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
confessed) to his friend's predictions, could only
look the surprise he felt. How any one, by
simply looking at a pony's track, could tell what
a party of men whom he had never seen were going
to do, he could not understand.</p>

<p>"To begin with," continued George, "our Indians
expected to have an addition made to their
party, and they expected also that it would be made
just where it <i>was</i> made. How do I know that?
By the looks of things. The ponies were all huddled
together in one place, and they must have stood
there a good while, judging by the stamping they
did. Their riders must have dismounted there, for
I saw the prints of their moccasins in the sand. I
noticed also that the side of the nearest sandhill had
been disturbed, and that told me that one of their
number had climbed up there to watch for the expected
warrior."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he was watching for us," suggested
Bob.</p>

<p>"If he was, he wouldn't have watched for us
with his feet, would he?" demanded George.</p>

<p>"'With his feet'?" echoed Bob.</p>

<p>"Yes. He would have been more likely to
watch for us with his eyes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>"How do you know that he didn't?"</p>

<p>"Because he climbed up on our side of the hill,
and that would have exposed his whole body to our
view if we had been anywhere within sight of him.
His eyes were turned the other way; that is, in
Lieutenant Earle's direction. He wasn't afraid of
being seen by us, but he took all due precautions to
conceal himself from the gaze of any one who might
happen to come that way from Lieutenant Earle's
command; for near the place where the ponies were
standing I saw the tufts of grass he had pulled up
to tie around his head."</p>

<p>"Well, I am beat!" exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>"What beats you?"</p>

<p>"You do: I didn't see any of those things."</p>

<p>"Probably you didn't, for the reason that you
didn't look for them. You see, I have passed a
good many years on the Plains, and I have learned
that eternal vigilance is the price of a cowboy's life
and liberty. When his scalp depends upon the correct
reading of such signs as those which I have
just described to you, he is not often caught napping.
My long association with Zeke, whose eyes
seemed to be everywhere, has got me into the habit
of keeping my own eyes open. Probably there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
were other things there that would have been
perfectly plain to Zeke or Mountain Mose which
I didn't see.</p>

<p>"Now, of course I don't <i>know</i> that this new
warrior brought Mr. Wentworth's children with
him when he came over to join our Indians, but
everything seems to point that way. One of the
proofs&mdash;and the strongest, in my humble opinion&mdash;is
found in the fact that the Indians allowed their
captives to dismount on the banks of that stream
the courier told us of. I am inclined to believe that
they went farther than that, and compelled the boys
to walk in the mud and leave their tracks there."</p>

<p>"I don't see why they did that," observed Bob.
"I should think they would want to keep everybody
from knowing where the boys were."</p>

<p>"So they would if they had intended to keep the
boys with them, but they did not. This is their
plan, as near as I can get at it; and in order to
make my explanation clearer I will call the party
of which Lieutenant Earle is in pursuit No. 1,
that which we want to find No. 2, and that the
captain is following up No. 3. The warriors in
No. 1 are doubtless the best mounted of all the
raiders. When they separated from the main<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
body they left a broad trail, so that they could be
easily followed, taking the children with them, and
leaving now and then a sign of their presence, for
no other purpose than to coax the captain to follow
them with his whole force. As soon as they reached
a piece of rocky ground, where a pony's feet
would leave no track, one of their number picked
up the boys and brought them over here, where
party No. 2 was waiting for him. Those he left
behind will show themselves to Lieutenant Earle
occasionally, and perhaps open a little fight with
him, just to induce him to continue the pursuit.
Party No. 3 will drive the stock ahead as fast as
possible, and get away with it if they can; but if
they find that they are likely to be overtaken, they
will drop the cattle and do everything they can to
keep the captain on their trail, so as to give party
No. 2 a chance to escape with the prisoners. Now,
that's a long story, and no doubt it is a hard one to
believe; but I don't think I am far from right when
I tell you that it is quite in your power to carry off
the honors of this expedition. Captain Clinton will
have his hands full until he recovers that stock; so
will Lieutenant Earle as long as he follows those
will-o'-the-wisps in front of him; and to you will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
be left the duty, as well as the privilege, of looking
out for the safety of Mr. Wentworth's little
boys."</p>

<p>"Whew!" panted Bob, who was very much impressed,
although not wholly convinced, by his companion's
clear and forcible reasoning. "Then I am
the chief man in this scout, am I? Suppose&mdash;I
say, just <i>suppose</i>&mdash;I should be lucky enough to
rescue those boys alive and unharmed, what would
the fellows say? What would Mr. Wentworth
say?"</p>

<p>"The boys would cheer you, and you would
win Mr. Wentworth's everlasting gratitude," replied
George. "But, Bob, the prisoners have not
been rescued yet, and I warn you that unless you
are as sly as a fox you will be the means of their
death. If the Indians discover you, and find themselves
unable to escape, their very first act will be
to kill those boys."</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" exclaimed Bob, dropping his
reins upon the horn of his saddle and pulling off
his cap with one hand while he scratched his head
vigorously with the other. "<i>Good</i> gracious! The
captain never thought of that when he sent me
off with this squad, did he? George, the responsi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>bility
is too heavy for me. I think I'll ask the
captain where he is, and then go and report to
him."</p>

<p>"That wouldn't be a very smart trick," protested
George. "You would not only be taken to task
for wasting valuable time, but the Indians, seeing
a smoke that they couldn't understand arise on
their trail, would take the alarm at once, and you
would lose a fine chance of distinguishing yourself."</p>

<p>"Don't you suppose they saw the smoke that
Lieutenant Earle sent up?"</p>

<p>"Of course they did&mdash;the captain's too. Those
same smokes were a good thing for us, for I am of
the opinion that they threw our party off their
guard by leading them to believe they are not pursued.
You mustn't send up a smoke along this
trail if you want to catch those Indians. What
are your orders, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"To follow the trail until I am recalled or until
the Indians throw me off entirely," replied
Bob.</p>

<p>"Then don't you see that you would be disobeying
orders by marching your squad back to the
column without a recall?" asked George. "You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
would surely get yourself into trouble by doing
that, and besides, you would be hauled over the
coals for not taking better care of your men and
horses. They couldn't stand twenty miles more
to-night without a rest, and how much of a rest
could they get here in this oven, with no grass
or water? Don't do it, Bob."</p>

<p>"But the prisoners&mdash;just think of the prisoners!"
exclaimed the perplexed corporal. "I don't
want to feel that I am responsible for any harm
that may befall them."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you are going to shirk it."</p>

<p>"Well, will you take command?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," answered George quickly.
"Don't confess your incapacity by surrendering
your authority. Besides, a scout never commands&mdash;he
only advises; and I will help you in
that way all I can. Go on, and say that you will
do your best."</p>

<p>"I will," said Bob, slamming his cap upon his
head and seating himself firmly in his saddle.
"If we can only place ourselves in a position to
cover those boys, the Indians will not have a
chance to touch them, I'll bet you. My men are
all good marksmen."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I am a tolerable one myself," said George.
"A single hair of those boys' heads is worth the
lives of all the Indians that ever saw the Staked
Plains, and if it becomes necessary to shoot in their
defence, I am ready. There is a high sandhill, and
if you will stop here for a few minutes I will go
up and see if I can discover anything."</p>

<p>Bob raised his hand to halt the squad, and
George swung himself out of his saddle. His
first care was to lay aside his cap and rifle, and his
next to pull up a quantity of grass and weeds to
be used as a screen. With these in one hand
and his field-glass in the other he crept slowly to
the top of the sandhill, and, holding the screen a
few inches above the ground, he pushed his field-glass
under it and looked around.</p>

<p>"Aha!" was his mental exclamation, "I shall
have good news to carry back to the boys. There's
a deep gully about five miles off, and there must be
a stream of water running through it, or else those
willows would not be growing there. I wish we
had got here an hour earlier, for then I should have
had daylight to aid me in making my observations.
The Indians probably halted in that gully
a few hours ago, and the question to be decided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
now is&mdash;Hallo! If that isn't smoke rising
among those trees, what is it? And didn't that
little cluster of bushes over there on the top of
that hill shift its position just now?"</p>

<p>George's heart beat wildly as he propounded these
inquiries to himself. He took another long look,
and then with a very slow and gradual motion he
deposited his screen upon the sand and backed
down to the plain. His stealthy movements told
the troopers that he had seen something.</p>

<p>"Corporal," said he as they rode up to him,
"before you ask any questions let me suggest that
you order your men to remove their sabres as
quietly as possibly."</p>

<p>Bob quickly unhooked his own sabre from his
belt, and looked at his men, who made all haste to
follow his example. They knew that there could
be but one reason for this order. A steel scabbard
hanging by the side of a careless rider will strike
against his spurs with every step his horse takes,
or rattle against his leg as the trooper walks about,
giving out a clear ringing sound that will betray
his presence to foes far less watchful and sharp-eared
than Indians.</p>

<p>"So we have run them into their holes, have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
we?" said Bob when he had acted upon George's
suggestion.</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen. They are camped
about five miles from here, and one of their lookouts
is watching the trail."</p>

<p>The troopers looked at Bob as if to ask what he
was going to do about it, and Bob, who had as little
idea of the orders he ought to give under the circumstances
as he had of the Greek language, looked
at George. The latter did not say anything, for he
wanted the troopers to hold fast to their belief that
the corporal was able to act for himself in any and
every emergency; but he gave his friend a look
that was plainly understood.</p>

<p>"Dismount," commanded Bob; "we'll rest here
until we can determine upon something. Let every
man keep fast hold of his horse, for a neigh from
one of them would make dough of our cake in a
little less than no time. Eat and whisper as much
as you please, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't smoke," put in George.</p>

<p>"Oh, Moses!" ejaculated the troopers in subdued
tones.</p>

<p>"An Indian will smell smoke from a pipe or a
camp-fire a long distance," added George.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then keep your pipes in your pockets, where
they can't do any mischief," said Bob.&mdash;"George,
I'd like to take a look at that camp."</p>

<p>George at once led the way up the hill, but when
he neared the top he said in a whisper,</p>

<p>"Perhaps you had better trust to my eyes instead
of your own; not but that you can see as far as I
can, but you might be a little careless in handling
that screen, and the least false motion on your part
would be seen by that lookout, whose eyes are as
good as a telescope."</p>

<p>"All right!" replied Bob, who wondered what
he should have done if George had not been there
to advise him. "What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Let me take another look, and then I will talk
to you."</p>

<p>So saying, George crept back to the top of the
hill and looked under his screen as before. It was
rapidly growing dark, but he could see that the
sentry still kept his position, and that the camp-fire
was burning brightly.</p>

<p>"They do not stand in the least fear of pursuit,"
said he as he backed down to Bob's side, "but they
have taken measures to prevent surprise, as they
always do when they are on the war-path."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>"How long do you suppose that sentry will stay
there?"</p>

<p>"Just as long as his friends stay in the gully.
I do not mean by that that this particular Indian
will act as lookout all the time, but that some
member of the party will be constantly on the
watch."</p>

<p>The first thing to be done was to decide upon
a plan of operations, and this took a good deal of
hard thinking, for there was a good deal depending
upon it. George made the most of the suggestions,
and Bob accepted every one of them without
argument. The camp was to be attacked as soon as
they could get within reach of it: both were agreed
upon that. Bob advised a surround, in order to
prevent the escape of any of the Indians; but
George objected, urging as a reason for his objections
that no one but an Indian could work his
way through those thick bushes and trees without
making a good deal of noise, and that would knock
the whole thing in the head.</p>

<p>"Don't be too ambitious," said he. "Don't try
to grab too big a handful, and so run the risk of
losing everything. Keep your men near you, so
that you can have an eye on every one of them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
Look out for the boys; and if by so doing you
give the Indians a chance to escape, as you will
most likely, let them go and welcome."</p>

<p>An immediate advance having been resolved
upon, and the part that each man was to play
in the coming fight (provided the Indians decided
to make a fight of it) having been thoroughly discussed,
Bob and his companion returned to the
place where they had left the troopers. The former
issued his orders in a few brief words, and in a very
short space of time eight barefooted men, armed only
with their carbines and revolvers, were drawn up in
line ready to do his further bidding; while the four
troopers who were to be left behind to hold the horses
and to take care of the sabres, shoes and stockings
which their lucky comrades had thrown upon the
ground, listened with as good grace as they could
to a few parting words from their corporal.</p>

<p>"Now, boys," said the latter, "keep quiet and
don't smoke. We have been following the trail of
only five Indians, but we don't know how many may
have joined them since they went into camp; so you
must hold yourselves in readiness for any emergency.
Keep a good lookout for the signal, and if you
don't see it by the time the moon rises, which will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
about midnight, take care of yourselves. Draw as
straight a course for the column as you can, and tell
the boys, when you find them, that the reds got the
best of us while we were trying to do our duty. Good-bye.&mdash;Lead
on, George."</p>

<p>Although our hero had passed his life amid scenes
of danger, and more than once listened to the sound
of hostile bullets (that was during the "neighborhood
row" of which we have spoken in the first
volume of this series), he had never before taken
part in a scout after Indians, and it may be readily
imagined that Bob's parting words did not serve to
encourage him in any great degree. Bob seemed to
think that there was a possibility that their attempted
surprise might end in utter defeat. The bare
thought was enough to make George's hair stand
on end, but it did not make him lose any of the
sympathy he felt for the boy-captives or falter in
his resolve to do all he could toward effecting their
release. In obedience to Bob's order to "lead on"
he raised his rifle to his shoulder and glided off into
the darkness, the troopers following in single file.
Before he had marched half a mile Bob hurried up
and placed himself by his side.</p>

<p>"Say, George," he whispered, "you are not going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
toward the camp. If you follow this course, you
will miss it by half a mile or more."</p>

<p>"I don't want to go toward the camp," was the
reply. "We must circle around so as to come up
in the rear of that sentry, who, as I told you, will
stay on the top of that hill as long as his friends
stay in the gully."</p>

<p>"Do you think we can capture him without
alarming the others?"</p>

<p>"We are not going to try; at least, I sha'n't
advise it. If we can save the boys, we ought to
be satisfied. That sentry will dig out as soon as
he scents danger, and all we can do is to let him
go."</p>

<p>"How awful still it is, and how fearful dark!"
continued Bob. "I hope you won't get confused
and miss your way."</p>

<p>"There is no danger of that," replied George
confidently. "I can see the stars, and they are as
good as a compass to me. I have often travelled
by them, and they have never fooled me yet."</p>

<p>"Where are the wolves, I wonder?" said Bob,
who was so impatient and so highly excited that
he could not long hold his peace. "They keep up
their unearthly howls every night when we wish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
them a thousand miles away, but now, when a yelp
from one of them would be a relief, they don't put
in an appearance."</p>

<p>"And I am glad of it," said George. "Don't
you know that a pack of wolves are the best
sentries a camping-party can have?"</p>

<p>Yes, Bob said he was aware of that fact.</p>

<p>"Well," continued George, "don't you see that
the little breeze there is stirring is blowing from
us toward the camp? If there were any wolves
around, they would probably be on the other side
of the gully, for it would be a waste of time for
them to prowl around here among these sandhills,
where they couldn't find even a rabbit to eat. The
moment they caught our wind they would scamper
off, and then 'Good-bye, prisoners.' I wish I knew
where those Indians have staked out their ponies,
for I stand more in fear of them than I do of that
sentry. If we should get to windward of them,
they would kick up a rumpus directly."</p>

<p>The longer Bob talked with George the more
clearly the difficulties attending his undertaking
seemed to stand but before him, and the greater
grew his anxiety and impatience. If his attempt
to surprise the Indian camp failed, there was no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
telling when Mr. Wentworth's boys would be heard
of again. If it suited their captors to spare their
lives, they would doubtless be sold to some band
who lived at a great distance from the agency, and
who would take the greatest pains to keep their existence
a profound secret. If they were ever given
up at all, it would only be after that particular band
had been soundly thrashed for some outrage, and
then they would be brought forward as an element
in the "peace negotiations," their captors demanding
a heavy ransom and taking great credit to themselves
for surrendering them. But this might not
happen for years, and during that time a great many
things might happen to the boys. They might become
so completely broken down by cruel treatment
that their death would be a blessing, or else so
thoroughly infatuated with the Indian mode of
life that, if left to themselves, they would choose
to go back to the wigwams of their savage masters
rather than return to the home of their father.</p>

<p>"It's now or never," said Bob to himself after
he had thought the matter over. "I don't wonder
that Mr. Wentworth feels so spiteful, for if these
Indians are not killed during this scout, they will
never be punished for what they have done to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
The government is too tender-hearted to touch
them, and if Mr. Wentworth takes the law into
his own hands, he will be sure to suffer for it.
They will go back to their agency to grow fat on
government grub and be kept warm in winter by
government blankets; and their agent, in order to
prevent an investigation that might take a few
dollars out of his pocket, will be ready to swear
that they have never been off their reservation.
I wonder how he would feel if he saw his own
children carried into captivity?"</p>

<p>For two long hours the weary troopers continued
the march, stopping for rest only when Bob and
George climbed some sandhill to reconnoitre the
ground before them. The deep silence that brooded
over the Staked Plains was almost oppressive.
The bare feet of the troopers gave out no sound as
they sank into the yielding sand, and all that could
be heard was their labored breathing as they walked
behind their leader, trusting implicitly to his
guidance. They never uttered a word, but Bob's
impatience and nervousness would have kept his
tongue in constant motion had it not been for
George, who gave him an energetic prod in the
ribs whenever he showed a disposition to become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
colloquial. He felt that he must do something
pretty soon or sink under his burden of responsibility,
which seemed to grow heavier the longer he
walked; consequently, when George stopped all of
a sudden and silently pointed his finger at a dense
wall of trees that ran across their path, his delight
knew no bounds. The ravine in which the Indians
were encamped was close in front of them.
The murmuring of the waterfall which came up
from its wooded depths was a pleasant sound to
his ears, but he and his troopers had much to
do before they could quench their thirst at that
rippling stream.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">TOP</a></span>
<h3>HE WINS IT FAIRLY.</h3>


<p>As it was not necessary to waste any precious
time in giving verbal orders, a complete code
of signals having been decided upon before they
left their horses, George at once threw himself
upon his hands and knees, and worked his way
along the edge of the bluff until he reached a
position directly above the camp, the location of
which was pointed out by a little blaze, scarcely
larger, apparently, than the flame of a candle. He
looked in vain for the sentry, and would have given
something handsome if there had been some one
at hand to tell him just where he was.</p>

<p>"If he still holds his position on the top of that
sandhill, we are all right," said George to himself,
"but if he has taken the alarm, we are all wrong.
In that case the Indians have done one of two
things: they have either made ready to ambush<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
us, or else they have fled, taking their prisoners
with them. Well, we shall soon know, for here
goes for the fight that none of us may ever come
out of alive."</p>

<p>As these thoughts passed through George's mind
he seized Bob's waist-belt and gave it two jerks,
which meant "Follow me." Then he crept back
along the line, and as he passed each trooper
he took him by the arm and pulled him around,
so that his head pointed toward the camp-fire.
This meant a movement by the right flank. After
this he and Bob placed themselves in the centre
of the line, the men giving way right and left
to make room for them, and at a given signal Bob
stuck his elbow into the ribs of the trooper to the
left of him, while George in a similar manner admonished
the one on the right of himself; and the
advance began, the guide being centre. We mean
by this that the men on Bob's left kept themselves
in their proper place in line by touching the shoulder
of the man next on their right, while those on
George's right hand kept within easy reach of the
men next on their left, each member of the line
moving no whit slower or faster than the guides
in the centre, Bob and George. If <i>they</i> stopped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
and listened and tried to peer through the bushes
in front of them to obtain a view of the camp, the
whole line stopped and listened and peered. When
the guides advanced the troopers did the same,
their movements being conducted without a whisper,
and with such extreme caution that scarcely a
leaf was heard to rustle. It took them almost an
hour to descend the bluff, which was probably
not more than a hundred feet in height, but the
sight that greeted them when the final halt was
made more than repaid them for all their toil.
They had crept up within less than a dozen yards
of the fire, and the camp and all its inmates were
in plain view of them.</p>

<p>Their first care was to find the boys, and the next
to ascertain the number and position of their adversaries.
The boys were there, lying side by side on
a bed of leaves, with their arms thrown around each
other, and wrapped in slumber as peaceful, apparently,
as ever came to their eyes while they were
safe under their father's roof. Every one of the
troopers shut his lips tightly at the sight of them,
and half a dozen cocked carbines were pointed over
their unconscious heads, ready to send to kingdom-come
the first thing in the shape of a Kiowa that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
dared approach them. They were not protected in
any way from the night air save by the branches
of the trees which waved gently above them, while
every one of the four Indians who were lying
around them was wrapped up head and ears in
a quilt or blanket which he had stolen during
the raid.</p>

<p>One sweeping glance was enough to enable Bob
and George to take in all these little details, and it
is scarcely necessary to say that they were highly
elated over the promise of success which the situation
seemed to hold out to them. Bob would have
been a little better satisfied if he could have seen
any way of taking the Indians alive, and so making
a "finished job of it," as he afterward told his friend
George; but, knowing that this was entirely beyond
his power, he was about to give the signal to advance
when a most unexpected interruption occurred.
They heard the snapping of twigs behind them,
accompanied by a slight rustling among the leaves,
such as might be made by some heavy body working
its way cautiously through the thick undergrowth.
The astonished troopers hugged the ground
closely, holding their breath in suspense; and in a
second more, without a single footstep being audible,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
the bushes parted and the form of an Indian warrior
could be dimly seen through the darkness.</p>

<p>"Beyond a doubt it is the sentry coming in to
call his relief," thought Bob. "<i>Now</i>, how am I
going to act? Shall I let him go into the camp,
or not?"</p>

<p>Without pausing an instant, the Indian, all unconscious
of danger, approached the line, and might
have passed through it between Bob and Carey without
discovering anything to excite his suspicions, had
not the former, acting upon the impulse of the moment,
made up his mind that he would not go back
to his comrades without at least one prisoner to reward
him for his long and tiresome scout. Throwing
out his arm, he caught the warrior around the
legs and lifting him from the ground threw him
upon his back. He fell across Carey and Loring,
both of whom turned like lightning and seized
him, one trying to secure his arms, so that he could
not draw a weapon, and the other taking him by
the throat. Everything was done quickly, but not
quickly enough to shut off the wild yell with which
the captive Indian awoke the echoes of the gully.
Seeing that all further attempts at concealment were
useless, Bob and George jumped to their feet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>"Forward with a cheer!" yelled the former.
"Cover the boys, everybody."</p>

<p>This last order was hardly necessary, for each
individual member of the squad had secretly resolved
to do that very thing, leaving his companions
to act as they pleased.</p>

<p>The Indians were wide awake and moving before
their unlucky comrade's yell had fairly left
his lips. So quickly did they spring to their
feet that the troopers might have thought, if they
had been allowed time to think at all, that the
savages had been merely keeping up an appearance
of sleep, so as to be ready to jump from their blankets
at the very first note of alarm. So well schooled
were they, and so ready to act, and to act quickly
and intelligently in any emergency, that they did
not hesitate an instant. They did not even look
to see from which way the danger that threatened
them was coming, but made a simultaneous rush for
their captives, intending, no doubt, to carry them
away if they could, or to kill them if they found
themselves surrounded so that they could not escape.
But no Indian's hand touched those boys again that
night. Three of them fell dead before they had
fairly left their tracks, and the other, taking warn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>ing
by their fate, dived into the bushes in much the
same way that a boy takes a "header" from a log,
and got safely off, in spite of the bullets which whistled
about his ears and scattered the leaves all over
him. The troopers knew that he had got off unhurt,
because there was no blood on the trail which
George took up the next morning and followed to
the place where the Indians had left their horses&mdash;a
little glade about a quarter of a mile from the camp
in which grass was abundant and water easy of
access.</p>

<p>George at once made his way to the side of the
captives, who were sitting up on their bed of leaves,
rubbing their eyes and looking about in a bewildered
sort of way, and throwing his arm around them
spoke soothing and encouraging words in their ears;
while Bob, after ordering one of his men to mend
the fire, seized a brand from it and ran back to see
what had become of Carey and Loring. The fight
was over, and Carey was growling lustily over a
wound in his arm which the slippery savage had
inflicted upon him, having managed in some mysterious
way to gain momentary possession of his
knife; but Loring was unharmed and the Indian
was insensible. He had been knocked out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
time by a vicious whack from the butt of a carbine
held in the hands of the enraged Carey. The
blow was not, however, as effective as the trooper
intended it should be, for it had expended a good
deal of its power upon the bushes which happened
to be in the way, and instead of sending the Indian
out of the world altogether, it had only stunned him.
He was powerless now. His hands were securely
confined by Loring's carbine-sling, and the latter,
having passed the Indian's blanket under his arms
and brought the ends together behind his back, was
ready to drag his captive into camp.</p>

<p>"I am no slouch&mdash;there isn't a boy in the troop,
young or old, who can take my measure on the
ground&mdash;but if this fellow gave us a fair specimen
of an Indian's way of rough-and-tumble fighting,
I don't want to get hold of any more Indians.&mdash;He
was a hard one, wasn't he?" said Loring, appealing
to his wounded comrade, who grunted out an emphatic
assent. "He didn't seem to be so very strong,
but he was just a trifle quicker than chain-lightning,
and as slippery and wiry as&mdash;as&mdash;Why, an
eel isn't nowhere alongside of him."</p>

<p>"I wish I had whacked him over the head before
he gave me this prod," said Carey, shaking his fist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
at the unconscious object of his wrath. "It's my
sword-arm too, and I'll just bet that the doctor
won't let me go on another scout for a month."</p>

<p>With Bob's aid the Indian was dragged into
camp, and thrown down there as if he had been
a sack of corn. The fire was burning brightly (an
Indian builds a small fire and gets close to it, while
a white man builds a big one and backs away from
it), the bodies of the slain warriors had been dragged
into the bushes out of sight, and their weapons,
saddles and bridles, which the troopers intended to
carry back to the fort with them as trophies of their
prowess, had been collected and deposited in a safe
place.</p>

<p>George had been devoting himself to the boys,
who did not seem to be at all afraid, and were by
no means so excited as he was. Their astonishing
courage called forth the unbounded admiration of
the troopers, and the pert answers they gave to the
questions that were asked them made them smile.</p>

<p>"Say, Bob, if you want to see what Texas boys
are made of, come here," said George. "The older
one answers to the name of Sheldon, and the little
fellow is Tommy. Sheldon says that if his
brother had been a little older and stronger the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
Indians never would have taken them to their
village, for they would have killed them and made
their escape."</p>

<p>"Humph!" grunted Carey, whose wound seemed
to put him in very bad humor.</p>

<p>"What makes you say that?" demanded Bob,
turning upon him somewhat sharply. "Don't
you know that such things have been done before
now?"</p>

<p>"By boys?" asked Carey.</p>

<p>"Yes, by boys," replied Bob.</p>

<p>"No, I don't know it," said the wounded
trooper.</p>

<p>"It's a matter of history, any way," said George.
"Two brothers, John and Henry Johnson, aged
respectively thirteen and eleven years of age, were
captured by two Delaware Indians on Short Creek,
West Virginia, in October, 1788. That very night
they killed their captors by shooting one and tomahawking
the other."</p>

<p>"Did they get away?" asked Sheldon eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, they got away. Now, I want to ask
you a few questions&mdash;and, Bob, I want you to pay
attention to his replies.&mdash;Where have you been to
get so much mud on your boots?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, back there in the plains we came to a
little bayou, and the banks of it was all muddy;
and the Injins they pulled us off the ponies and
made us walk into all that there mud, and then
they laughed at us because we didn't like it," answered
the boy; and his ludicrous display of rage
over the indignity that had been put upon himself
and his brother made the troopers smile again.</p>

<p>"Go on," said George. "What did you do
next?"</p>

<p>"Well, they took us out of the mud after a
while, the Injins did, and then one of 'em he took
us on a pony and rode off by himself until he found
this party; and we've been with them ever since."</p>

<p>"What did I tell you?" exclaimed George, hitting
Bob a back-handed slap on the chest. "What
do you think of my guessing now?"</p>

<p>"I think you are pretty good at it," answered
Bob. "And seeing you <i>are</i>, I wish you would
try your hand in a new line. Suppose you take a
couple of men with you, and all our canteens and
coffee-pots, and guess your way down the bluff to
the stream, and bring us back a supply of water?
We'll have a good fire going by the time you return,
and then we'll boil a cup of coffee."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll do it," said George readily.</p>

<p>"And while you are guessing, guess at the
probable movements of that Indian who got
away," continued Bob. "Will he be likely to
trouble us to-night?"</p>

<p>"He will not," was the confident reply. "Our
party is too large. He will make the best of his
way home, you may depend upon it."</p>

<p>While George and the two troopers whom Bob
detailed to accompany him were gone after the
water, those who remained in camp were not idle.
One bound up Carey's wounded arm, another
brought in a bountiful supply of fire-wood, others
stood guard, and one assisted the corporal in collecting
a quantity of leaves and light branches, and
went out with him to signal to the four men who
had been left behind with the horses. They readily
found the hill which had served as a lookout-station
for the warrior who was now a captive in
their hands; and they knew it when they found it,
for there was the pile of bushes through which he
had looked while watching the trail, and the print
of his body in the sand. A fire was speedily lighted
on the summit, and kept burning brightly to
guide the absent troopers to the captured camp.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
That little beacon shining through the darkness
must have been a welcome sight to their eyes,
for it told of the complete success of their companions
and of the rest and water that were to
be found where they were.</p>

<p>When George returned to the camp after nearly
half an hour's absence he found the fire blazing
cheerily, and the two rescued boys, who seemed
almost exhausted by their long journey, sleeping
soundly beside it, covered by a quilt which some
kind-hearted trooper had thrown over their shoulders.
The troopers were laughing heartily but
silently at Carey and Loring, who seemed to bear
their merriment with very bad grace.</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?" inquired George as
he distributed the canteens among them and placed
the coffee-pots beside the fire.</p>

<p>"Come here and see for yourself," replied Loring,
taking George by the arm and leading him
to the place where the captive Indian lay, all the
troopers following at his heels.</p>

<p>"Me good Injun," grunted the prisoner, who
seemed to have recovered his senses.</p>

<p>"So I perceive," replied George. "Good Indians
steal stock and carry off white boys, don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
they?&mdash;But I don't see anything about him to
laugh at."</p>

<p>"Why, he's nothing but a kid," exclaimed Phillips,
"and yet Carey and Loring are both willing
to confess that it was all they could do to handle
him. They told us a wonderful story about the
terrible fight they had before they could tie him,
and so we took a look at him, expecting to find
him a giant; but instead of that&mdash;Well, you
can see that he's only a papoose."</p>

<p>George looked down at the boyish face and
slender figure of the young warrior, then at the
two grizzly old veterans who had fought so hard
to capture him, and felt more than half inclined
to laugh himself. Either one of them could have
strangled him with a finger and a thumb if he
could have got hold of him; but getting a good
hold was the trouble. An Indian makes up in
suppleness and activity what he lacks in strength,
and it takes a good man to handle one. Of course
the troopers were sorry for their wounded comrade,
but they had "got a joke" on him, and it was a
long time before he heard the last of it.</p>

<p>The men who had been left to take care of the
horses arrived in about an hour, and then George<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
had another disagreeable task to perform, which
was to pilot the animals down to the water and
find a feeding-ground for them. Being entirely
unacquainted with the gully and surrounding country,
it took him a long time to do this; but he accomplished
it at last, in spite of the darkness, and
about one o'clock in the morning he was at liberty
to go to his blanket.</p>

<p>The troopers slept later than usual the next
morning, for they were all tired out; but Bob's
loud call of "Catch up!" brought them to their
feet before the sun had risen high enough to send
any of his rays into the camp. As there was a
good deal to be done and but little time to do it
in, four details were made, and certain duties assigned
to each. The first, which consisted solely
of Loring, was ordered to dish up a cup of coffee
in a little less than no time; George and Phillips
were instructed to follow up the trail of the missing
Indian and see where it led to; Bob and a
companion bent their steps toward the sandhill to
ascertain the whereabouts of the main body of the
expedition; and the others brought in the horses
and gave them the grain that was left in the saddle-pockets.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>Before ascending the hill Bob and his companion
gathered each an armful of dry grass and weeds.
These were deposited upon the highest part of the
hill and lighted by a match which Bob struck on
his coat-sleeve. As soon as the blaze was fairly
started, but before the whole pile was ignited, Bob
smothered it by throwing on more grass and weeds;
and when this was done a column of smoke that
could be seen at the distance of fifty miles began
to rise in the air.</p>

<p>"Now let me see," said Bob, pulling out the
paper which Captain Clinton had copied from
his note-book when he started him on the trail.
"I want to say, 'Where are you, captain?' and
how shall I say it?"</p>

<p>He ran his eye down the page and finally found
these instructions:</p>

<p>"A detached party desiring to ascertain the position
of the main body will signal as follows: A long
smoke of a minute's duration; three short smokes,
followed by half a minute's interval; two short
smokes, with half a minute's interval; one short
smoke, followed immediately by a long one. If
the signal is observed, the reply will be the same.
If no reply is received in five minutes, repeat from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
some other and, if possible, higher point, and so
continue until an answering signal is seen."</p>

<p>As the reader may not quite understand this, we
will tell just how Bob made the signal. He allowed
the column of smoke to ascend just one
minute by his watch, then took a blanket from his
shoulder and with a quick movement threw it over
the smoldering pile, holding two of the corners
tight to the ground, while his companion held the
opposite corners. This, of course, confined the
smoke so that no more arose. At the end of half
a minute he raised the blanket three times in quick
succession, and three balloon-shaped clouds floated
off over the sandhills. Waiting half a minute, he
lifted the blanket twice, and two more little clouds
arose. At the end of another half a minute he
permitted a single cloud to escape, and then threw
the blanket off altogether; whereupon a long,
slender column, like the one that arose when the
fire was first started, shot up into the air. Then
Bob seated himself on the ground and waited
rather anxiously for a reply; but he was not obliged
to wait long. Before the five minutes had
elapsed an answering smoke was seen; and though
it was a long distance off, the atmosphere was so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
clear, and the white clouds showed so plainly
against the blue sky, that the signal could be
plainly read. It was the same as the one Bob
had just sent up, and so he knew that it was intended
for him.</p>

<p>This mode of signalling, which is usually called
"telegraphing by smokes," is in general use among
the Plains Indians, and it was from them that our
army-officers serving on the border caught the idea.
Of course they have a system of their own, which
is very different from that of the Indians. The
latter cannot read an army-signal, and neither can
the officers, with all their striving and scheming,
gain a key that will enable them to read the Indian
code. It is as much of a mystery as the
manner in which a chief conducts a drill of his
warriors or controls them in battle without appearing
to hold any communication with them. Both
these secrets are closely guarded, the Indians considering
that it would be "bad medicine" to reveal
them to the white man.</p>

<p>"Did you see the exact spot from which
that smoke arose?" Bob asked of his companion.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the trooper.</p>

<p>"Then fix it in your mind, so that you can point<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
it out to George Ackerman. Now that our work
is done we will go back to camp."</p>

<p>Breakfast was soon despatched, and in less than
half an hour the squad was again on the move,
three of the troopers, in order to accommodate the
rescued boys and the Indian captive, being obliged
to "carry double." Their route lay along the edge
of the bluff, within easy reach of water, only three
halts being made&mdash;one for dinner, and two for the
purpose of sending up signals to Captain Clinton.
As his replies, which were promptly made, came
from the same place, Bob became satisfied that the
captain was waiting for him. Of course this caused
much speculation among the troopers. Had the
captain given up the pursuit, or had he overtaken
and scattered the thieves and recovered Mr. Wentworth's
stock? Bob was inclined to hold to the
latter opinion.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p291.jpg" alt="p291" title="illus_032b"/></div>
<div class="figcenter"><span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Telegraphing by Smoke.</span></span></div>

<p>"The captain is a hard man to get away from
when he once makes up his mind for business,"
said he; "and I just know that he's got those
cattle, or the most of them. If he has, Mr. Wentworth
is all right, for we have got his boys. If
your theory is correct&mdash;and I begin to believe it is,
for everything else has turned out just as you said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
little end of the horn, won't he?"</p>

<p>"Some officer almost always has to do that,"
answered George. "But the lieutenant will have
some honor reflected upon him, if he doesn't win
any for himself, for it was a portion of his own
troop, commanded by one of his own non-commissioned
officers, who rescued the boys."</p>

<p>About two hours before sunset the troopers began
to call one another's attention to the fact that
the sandhills, among which they had been marching
all day long, were growing less in number and
height, and to congratulate themselves on drawing
near to their journey's end. An hour later they
came to the last hill, and as they were riding by
it a sentry who had been stationed there presented
himself to their view.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">TOP</a></span>
<h3>"THREE CHEERS FOR THE 'BRINDLES'!"</h3>


<p>"Hallo, Buel!" exclaimed Bob, recognizing
in the sentry one of his own company boys,
"you'll let us in, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I <i>am</i> beat!" replied the man. "Corporal,
you're a brick. Three cheers for the 'Brindles'!"</p>

<p>He stood in the "position of a soldier," with his
carbine at a "carry," and spoke in a low tone, for
he knew that there were officers with field-glasses
not far away, and that he had no business to exchange
compliments with anybody after this fashion
while he was on post. But when he saw the
captive Indian and Mr. Wentworth's boys he
could not restrain himself.</p>

<p>"Bob, the boys ought to give you a benefit," he
added.</p>

<p>"We've got something to show for this scout,
even if we are 'Brindles,' haven't we?" said the
corporal, holding himself very stiffly in his saddle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
and looking straight before him, so as not to 'give
the sentry away.' "Have you beaten us any?"</p>

<p>"Not by a great sight."</p>

<p>"What have you done, anyway?"</p>

<p>"We've got the most of the stock back, but nary
red. Where's Lieutenant Earle?"</p>

<p>"Haven't seen him," answered Bob.</p>

<p>"We haven't seen him either, nor have we heard
from him since that courier arrived."</p>

<p>The troopers now found themselves on the border
of a wide plain, whose opposite side was
bounded by a long line of willows, which fringed
the banks of a water-course. On the edge of the
willows were gathered the members of the main
body, who, having been apprised by their sentinels
of the approach of Bob and his party, had assembled
to see them come in. Bob began to grow excited
at once. He and his men had performed no
ordinary exploit, and so impatient was he to have
his success known to his comrades that he could
not wait until he reached the camp to tell his story.</p>

<p>"You fellows who carry double, ride out there
and square yourselves around, so that they can see
that we have not returned empty-handed," commanded
Bob, who forthwith proceeded to ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>ecute his own order
by placing the three men
who "carried double" one behind the other, broadside
to the camp, so that the officers with their field-glasses
could observe that each horse had two riders
on his back. "I declare I feel like one of those
old Roman conquerors&mdash;on a small scale; but in
order to carry out the role I ought to make one
end of a lariat fast to that Indian's neck and drag
him into the camp, oughtn't I? That's the way
the Romans used to do with their captives, only
they chained them to their chariot-wheels. There
you are!&mdash;Swing your caps, you kids, and holler,
to let your father know you are here."</p>

<p>The boys obeyed with alacrity, swinging their
caps around their heads and laughing and shouting
by turns, while the two soldiers behind whom they
rode raised their own caps on the muzzles of their
carbines and joined in with a wild soldier yell.
George Ackerman kept watch of the camp through
his glass to note the movements of its inmates and
make reports of the manner in which this demonstration
was received by them.</p>

<p>"There's the captain," said he. "He is coming
out in front of the men, in company with some
of the officers. Now they are all looking at us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
through their glasses. Now the captain has taken
down his glass and is saying something. Here
they come!"</p>

<p>It was evident that the captain had reported the
result of his observations, for as George uttered
these last words and lowered his glass the men
broke into a run and dashed across the plain, raising
their charging-yell as they came.</p>

<p>"You fellows who carry double, take the post
of honor," commanded Bob; "ride at the head
of the squad.&mdash;Say, boys," he added, facing about
in his saddle and speaking to the men behind him,
"look out for Wentworth. There was a look in
his eye the last time I saw him that I didn't at all
like, and when he finds out that we have captured
one of the Indians, he may&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There he comes now!" exclaimed one of the
troopers.</p>

<p>Bob looked toward the camp, and saw that his
man had not been mistaken. Behind the troopers,
who were still running forward to meet their returning
comrades, but rapidly overhauling them
with every jump of his horse, was the father of
the rescued boys. He rode without saddle, bridle
or hat, his long hair was streaming straight out be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>hind
him, he carried in his hand the rifle with
which he had done such deadly work while he
was defending his home, and he was constantly
digging his heels into the sides of his horse, as if
he were trying to make him go faster. The man
could have but one object in view: that was Bob's
opinion, and it must have been Captain Clinton's
opinion too, judging by his actions. The latter
had raised both hands to his face and stood with
his head thrown back, as if he were shouting out
some orders; but if he gave any they were drowned
in the lusty cheers of the approaching troopers,
who ran as if they were engaged in a foot-race.</p>

<p>"That man certainly means mischief," said
George.</p>

<p>"I am sure of it," replied the corporal. "But
I should act in just the same way if I were in his
place. I'd put an end to that Indian in spite of
all the soldiers that ever wore the 'honored blue;'
but that, I know, would be very wrong, for this
red imp is one of the government wards, and nobody
must presume to lay an ugly hand on him."</p>

<p>"What would be done with Mr. Wentworth if
he should shoot your prisoner?" asked George.</p>

<p>"'What would be done with him?'" repeated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Bob, bitterly. "Why, he would be put in arrest
before he could say 'Jerusalem!' and the agent
of the Kiowas would insist on his being tried for
murder, notwithstanding the fact that this same
Indian was one of the party that burned Mr.
Wentworth's house and carried his children into
captivity. Why, George, unless you are posted
you have no idea&mdash;But I will tell you a short
story by and by. Just now I must attend to our
friend Mr. Wentworth. Stand by me, for I believe
I shall need a helping hand before I get through
with him."</p>

<p>While this conversation was going on Bob had
kept a watchful eye upon the movements of Mr.
Wentworth, who had by this time passed the troopers
and was guiding his horse so as to come up on
the left flank of Bob's squad. As soon as the latter
became satisfied that this was the man's intention,
he rode out of the line and placed himself beside
the captive Indian, who was riding on Loring's
horse and was by no means an uninterested spectator
of what passed before him. He too was
keeping his gaze directed toward Mr. Wentworth,
whom he doubtless recognized.</p>

<p>"White man very angry&mdash;heap mad&mdash;as mad,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
in fact, as a wet hen," said Bob, trying to imitate
an Indian's way of talking, but making a sad mess
of it in his excitement. "He's mad at you for carrying
his boys off, and he's going to shoot you dead&mdash;heap
dead&mdash;as dead as a door-nail; and he'll serve
you just right, too."</p>

<p>"I hope he won't miss the red and hit me," said
Loring.</p>

<p>"You needn't be afraid of that, for these Texans
are all good shots," answered Bob; adding in
a lower tone, "I'll just tell you what's a fact, Loring:
I wouldn't interfere with him if I could
help it."</p>

<p>The young savage understood what Bob said,
but not a muscle of his face changed. If he had
been an old warrior, he would probably have begun
his death-chant; but having performed no
deeds of which he could boast, he remained silent
and calmly awaited the fate that would have been
inevitable had it not been for George Ackerman's
skill in horsemanship.</p>

<p>The animal on which Mr. Wentworth was mounted
was evidently accustomed to being ridden without
a bridle, for his master guided him with the
greatest ease. When he had almost reached the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
squad he suddenly swerved from his course, in
obedience to a signal conveyed to him by a quick
movement of his rider's body, and galloping swiftly
around the head of the line stopped short on the
other flank. By this unexpected change of tactics
the enraged father had gained a position on the unguarded
side of the prisoner, and if he had acted
as soon as his horse came to a standstill he would
have accomplished his purpose in spite of everything;
but he could not resist the temptation to
talk for just a moment, and that moment's delay
defeated him. Cocking his rifle with great deliberation,
he said fiercely,</p>

<p>"You have eaten salt in my house, you have slept
by my fire, you have drunk from my spring when
you were thirsty, you Indian dog, and now&mdash;"</p>

<p>When the man had gone thus far rage choked
his utterance, and he could not say another word.
He drew his rifle to his shoulder, but the muzzle,
instead of covering the head of the Indian, covered
the person of George Ackerman, who was coming
toward him with all the speed his horse could
put forth.</p>

<p>The boy had sprung into life and activity the
instant he witnessed Mr. Wentworth's cunning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
manoeuvre, for he knew what it meant. Giving
a pull at his left rein, at the same time touching
his horse lightly with the spurs, the animal wheeled
like a flash on his hind feet, and, dashing through
the line behind Bob Owens (some of the troopers
afterward declared that he jumped clear over Bob's
horse), brought his rider to the right side of the
Indian just in time to intercept the deadly aim.
In another second George had seized the rifle
with both hands, and a terrific struggle began between
him and Mr. Wentworth for the possession
of the weapon. In less time than it takes to tell
it the man, having no stirrups to support him, was
jerked off his horse, and before he could recover
himself and plant his feet firmly on the ground
the rifle was twisted out of his grasp, and the
bullet contained in the chamber was sent whistling
harmlessly off over the sandhills.</p>

<p>"No more of that!" exclaimed Bob, who rode
up just half a minute too late to be of any assistance.
"Keep quiet now, or you'll go back to
camp with a guard over you."</p>

<p>"Mr. Wentworth," said George, bending down
from his saddle and laying his hand upon the
angry man's shoulder, "your good sense must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
tell you that the corporal can't stand peaceably
by and see his prisoner shot. What are you
thinking of?"</p>

<p>"Give me that gun," panted Mr. Wentworth,
who was white to the lips and trembling in every
limb. "I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll do nothing but behave yourself," interrupted
Bob. "You can't have that rifle again
until Captain Clinton says so, for you don't know
how to act when you have it in your hands; you
point it around too loose and reckless. Haven't
you something besides revenge to think of now?
Can't you see that we have brought your boys
back to you safe and sound?"</p>

<p>The man's face softened at once. Tears came
to his eyes, and darting quickly around Bob's
horse he ran up to his children, and, pulling them
both to the ground at once, folded them in his arms.
But we will not say any more about that meeting,
will we? The joy of a family reunited under
circumstances like these is something too sacred
to be intruded upon even by a sympathizing pen,
isn't it? Even the troopers, some of whom had
witnessed many an affecting scene, could not stand
it, but turned away their heads and drew their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
hands hastily across their eyes, as if to brush away
something that seemed to be obscuring their vision.
One of them caught Mr. Wentworth's horse, and
after the latter had mounted and taken his boys
up with him, one in front and the other behind,
the squad continued its march toward the camp.</p>

<p>When Bob came to look in front of him, he
found that the appearance of things had changed
somewhat. The comrades who had started out to
meet him were no longer advancing in a compact
body. They had halted and drawn themselves up
in two parallel lines, facing each other, and leaving
room enough between them for Bob and his
squad to pass through.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" exclaimed the delighted corporal.
"The boys have got up a reception for us, and
we must meet it in good shape.&mdash;Attention, squad!
Draw sabres!&mdash;Loring, ride on ahead with Mr.
Wentworth.&mdash;George, come up on my right."</p>

<p>When these orders were issued the men promptly
fell into line, conversation ceased on the instant,
tobacco was knocked out of pipes that had but
just been filled, carbines were adjusted in soldier-fashion,
caps that had been worn with the
peak behind were turned right side in front, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
twelve bright blades leaped from their scabbards.
In this order the successful troopers rode by their
comrades, who cheered them loudly, and then fell
in behind and followed them into camp, marching
in column of fours. Bob at once rode up to Captain
Clinton's fire, and dismounted to make his
report, which he did in this way:</p>

<p>"I have the honor, sir, to report that we surprised
five Indians in camp last night, captured
one, killed three and released Mr. Wentworth's
boys."</p>

<p>"Good for you, corporal!" exclaimed the captain,
his astonishment getting the better of him
for the moment. "Anybody hurt on your side?"</p>

<p>"One wounded, sir. Private Carey received a
knife-thrust in the right arm while assisting Private
Loring to capture the Indian."</p>

<p>"Very good," said the captain, resuming his
official tones and dignity at the same time. "Stake
out your horses, and then come back here. I want
to hear all the particulars. What was the cause of
that disturbance out there on the plain?"</p>

<p>"I was the cause of it, cap, you bet," exclaimed
Mr. Wentworth, whose face did not look
much as it did when he galloped out to meet Bob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
and his squad. Then it was disturbed with passion;
now it was beaming with joy. "I'd ha'
sent that Injin to the happy land o' Canaan in a
little less than the shake of a buck's tail if Ackerman
hadn't stopped me, you bet."</p>

<p>"It was a good thing for you that he did stop
you," said the captain quietly. "You would have
brought yourself into serious trouble by such a
proceeding."</p>

<p>"I know that," said Mr. Wentworth, "but who
cares for trouble when his dander's up? Say, cap,
may I have my rifle? Ackerman took it away
from me."</p>

<p>"You may have it on condition that you will
make no more attempts on the life of this prisoner,"
replied the captain. "There is a law to
deal with such fellows as he is."</p>

<p>"Where in the world is it, I'd like to know?"
exclaimed Mr. Wentworth fiercely. "It hasn't got
out here to Texas yet. If I had shot him, as I
meant to do, you would have had a guard over
me in no time; but he came with a band of his
friends and set fire to my house, and carried off
my little boys, and killed my herdsmen, and drove
off my stock; and you, knowing it all, stand here,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
with your hundred and twenty blue-coats, and tell
me that I must not touch him. Your colonel will
give him up when his agent makes a demand for
him, and he'll go back to his reservation, and
the government will feed him on good food and
give him good clothes, and some rascally trader
will sell him more powder and balls to kill white
folks with; but if <i>I</i>&mdash;Dog-gone my buttons!&mdash;Ackerman,
give me that rifle."</p>

<p>It was plain that Mr. Wentworth's "dander"
was still "up"&mdash;'way up. The listening troopers
exchanged glances of approval with one another,
and would have cheered him if they had dared.
Being a civilian, the man was at liberty to talk
pretty much as he pleased; but if one of their own
number had made such an exhibition of temper
in the presence of an officer, he would have been
punished for it.</p>

<p>"We will not discuss that matter," said the
captain calmly. "I know my business and attend
to it strictly, leaving the agents to look out
for their own affairs. They are not responsible
to me, or to you either, for the manner in which
they do the work entrusted to them."</p>

<p>"All right, cap," said Mr. Wentworth, picking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
up one of his boys and then lowering him carefully
to the ground. "Mum is the word, if you say so.
But I haven't heard you tell Ackerman to give
me that rifle yet."</p>

<p>"Neither have I heard you make that promise,"
was the reply.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll make it, but I tell you I hate to,
mightily."</p>

<p>The captain smiled, and nodded to George, who
rode up and handed over the Winchester.</p>

<p>"She's a good one, cap, and when she speaks
she means business&mdash;<i>she</i> does," said Mr. Wentworth,
holding the recovered weapon off at arm's
length and gazing at it with admiring eyes. "She
is sure death on Kiowas, for she knows I have got
something ag'inst them. She rubbed out ten of
'em during the last fight she was in, and she'll
spoil the good looks of many more of them before
I hand her over to my oldest boy for good.&mdash;Put
her on your shoulder, Sheldon, and come on."</p>

<p>Lifting his youngest child in his arms, Mr.
Wentworth walked away, Sheldon marching
proudly by his side with the rifle on his shoulder,
and the horse following quietly at his heels. Then
Bob and George rode away with the squad, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
troopers gradually dispersed, and the captain and
his officers went back to the blankets on which
they had been dozing away the time while waiting
for Corporal Owens.</p>

<p>If it had not been for the fact that he had
nearly a thousand head of recaptured stock on
his hands, the captain would have set out for the
fort at once; but it is almost impossible to drive
Texas cattle during the night, for they are about
half wild, anyway, and as easily stampeded as a
herd of buffaloes. Under favorable circumstances
two men who understand their business can take
care of a herd of five hundred of them; but this
stock which the captain had just recovered from
the Indians had grown so unmanageable during
the short time they had been in the possession of
the raiders, who had pushed them ahead night and
day at their greatest speed, that it took thirty well-mounted
troopers to keep them within bounds.
If they became quieted down during the night,
the captain intended to set out for the fort with
the main body of his men early the next morning,
leaving a few of his troopers to assist Mr. Wentworth
to drive the cattle in.</p>

<p>"I say, corporal," exclaimed Carey as Bob led<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
his squad away, "where does Wentworth hang
out? What mess does he grub with?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Bob. "I saw him
going toward the other end of the camp."</p>

<p>"Now, such work as that won't do," continued
Carey. "He'll go up there among those high-toned
Grays or Blacks, and they will honey
around those boys of his and make much of them,
and cut us Brindles completely out of their good
graces. They belong to us, and they ought to stay
with us; don't you say so?"</p>

<p>Bob replied that he did say so.</p>

<p>"Can't we bring them into our mess?" asked
Carey.</p>

<p>"You can try. I'll take care of your horse if
you want to make the attempt."</p>

<p>Carey at once dismounted, and started back toward
the upper end of the camp, and Bob rode
on to find the place where his troop had staked
out their horses. While he is looking for it we
will explain what the words "Grays," "Blacks"
and "Brindles," as used by Private Carey, meant.</p>

<p>One of the first things to be done in a new regiment
of cavalry, or in an old one that has just been
remounted, is to "color the horses." We mean by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
this that the animals are divided into lots according
to their color, the blacks being placed in one
lot, the grays in another, the whites in another,
and so on. After these divisions are made there
are always some "off" horses, such as roans and
browns, which are put into a lot by themselves
and called the "brindles." The ranking captain
then makes his choice of the colors. For the sake
of illustration, we will suppose that he prefers to
have his company mounted on black horses. He
first takes the finest animal in the lot for his own
use, his first lieutenant comes next, the second
lieutenant next, the first sergeant next, and so on
down through all the sergeants and corporals, each
one selecting according to his rank. Then those
of the privates who have proved themselves to be
the best soldiers are called up one by one, and after
they have made their selections the shirks and
grumblers, like Bristow and Gus Robbins, have
to take those that are left.</p>

<p>The captain who is second in command makes the
next choice of colors, and his horses are distributed
in the same way. The whites are generally
chosen next to the last, not because they are not
as good or as handsome as the others, but for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
reason that it is harder work for the men to keep
them clean, and in action they present conspicuous
marks for the rifles of the enemy. "The brindles,"
the horses of all colors and of no color at all to speak
of, are the only ones left, and the lowest company
commander must take them because he has no choice.
He does not like them, and neither do his men, because
the troop that is doomed to ride them cannot
make so fine appearance on dress-parade as the others
do, and for the reason that the Brindles are the butt
of all the jokes that old soldiers can play upon one
another. When we have said that we have said a
good deal, for if there is any mischief that a lot of
veterans will not think of when they have a leisure
hour on their hands, we don't know what it is.</p>

<p>When the horses were "colored" at Fort Lamoine
the brindles fell to the lot of Lieutenant
Earle, as he was the lowest company commander,
all the others being captains. This was the troop
to which Bob Owens belonged, and, in common
with its other members, he had suffered from the
practical jokes that had been played upon him
by the more fortunate troopers. But of late these
jokes were not as frequent as they had formerly
been, for the "Brindles" had proved themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
to be the best of soldiers. When their achievements
were taken into consideration they led every
troop in the garrison. They had gallantly borne
their part in every duty they were called on to
perform, their non-commissioned officers had invariably
been successful when sent out in pursuit
of deserters, and now one of them had done something
for which the members of his regiment were
glad to honor him in the way we have described.
During the rest of Bob's life at Fort Lamoine but
little was said about the despised Brindles; but if
any trooper <i>did</i> forget himself and make disparaging
remarks concerning them or their "ringed,
streaked and striped" horses, some listening Brindle
would promptly interrupt him with&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look here, Bub, we didn't enlist to show ourselves
off on dress-parade. When you Blacks" (or
Grays or Chestnuts, as the case might be, the offending
trooper being designated by the color of
the horses on which his company was mounted)
"have followed an Indian trail across the Staked
Plains, and been burned up by an August sun, and
had your mouths and throats filled so full of sand
that you couldn't tell the truth for a whole month,
and have surprised a party of hostiles in their camp,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
and rescued two prisoners alive and unharmed,&mdash;when
you have done all that, you can talk; until
then hold your yawp. That feat has never been
accomplished but once in the Department of Texas,
and then it was accomplished by <i>our</i> boys, the Brindles
of the &mdash;&mdash;th Cavalry."</p>

<p>Bob and his men were proud of that exploit, and,
what was more, they did not mean to be robbed of
any of the honor they had won. That was one
reason why they wanted to bring Mr. Wentworth
and his boys into their mess. They supposed they
were going back to the fort with Captain Clinton's
command, and they wanted to carry those boys
through the gate themselves. But, as it happened,
the captain had decided upon something else, and
by that decision had unconsciously given Bob's
lucky squad of Brindles an opportunity to add
to their laurels. We shall see what use they made
of it.</p>

<h3>MORE BAD LUCK FOR MR. WENTWORTH.</h3>


<p>While Bob and his men were staking out
their horses they were besieged by anxious
Brindles who wanted to know just where they had
been and what they had done during their absence.
No incident connected with the experience of their
successful comrades was deemed too trivial for their
notice. Bob and the rest answered their questions
as fast as they were able, and asked a good many
in return. They learned that Captain Clinton had
fallen in with the stolen cattle about one o'clock
that morning, but the Indians they had hoped to
find with them were not to be seen. The captain
had pursued them so closely that they did not have
time to drive the stock into the Staked Plains, to
die there of thirst, and neither did they harass
the column, as George said they would. Their
force was too small to accomplish anything by it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
The captain had spent all the forenoon in gathering
up the stock, and it was now feeding on the prairie
close by, guarded by a large squad of troopers.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what's a fact, boys," said one of
the Brindles. "This raid must have been a big
thing, for just after you left us we struck the trail
of a large drove that joined ours, and a little farther
on we found another. But they were both older
than our own, so the scout said, and the drove we
followed was left behind as a sort of bait for us to
swallow, while the main herd was driven off."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you go on after the main herd?"
asked Bob.</p>

<p>"It would have been of no use. It had too
much of a start; and besides, we have already
got just as much on our hands as we can attend to.
We have been all day gathering up the cattle we
have got, and it is just all we can do to hold fast
to them. The fellows up there must attend to the
rest."</p>

<p>By "the fellows up there" the troopers meant
to indicate the cavalry attached to the several posts
north of the Staked Plains.</p>

<p>When Bob went back to the captain's head-quarters,
George, being a privileged character, went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
with him. The officer questioned them closely
in regard to their movements, took copious notes
to assist him in making out his report to the colonel,
and by the time he got through he came to
the conclusion that the two young men deserved
especial mention for the skill and courage they had
exhibited. He rewarded them on the spot by giving
them more work to do&mdash;some that was not supposed
to have any danger in it, but which, nevertheless,
gave them an opportunity to show whether
the success that had attended them during their
last scout was owing to good luck or good management.</p>

<p>"I am more than satisfied, because you have accomplished
more than I expected of you," said the
captain as he put his note-book into his pocket.
"As you will probably have some hard riding to
do to-morrow, I will see that you are allowed a
good night's rest."</p>

<p>"Are we going back to the fort in the morning,
sir?" asked George.</p>

<p>Although Bob was fully as anxious as his companion
was to know what the captain meant by
saying that he and his squad would probably have
some hard riding to do the next day, he never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
would have dared to ask such a question; and if
he had, the officer, if he had made any reply at all,
would very likely have told him that he would find
out all about it in due time. But he expressed no
surprise at George's inquisitiveness.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> am going back to fort," said he, "but you
and the corporal will have to stay and help Mr.
Wentworth with the cattle. You will be of more
use to him, George, than half a dozen green hands,
for you know how to drive stock and can act as instructor
to the rest. You know where Holmes's
ranche is, I suppose? Well, I shall want the corporal
to stay with Mr. Wentworth until he gets
there, and then you will have to guide the squad
to the fort. If you should happen to meet any
raiders on the way, why take them in," added the
captain with a smile.&mdash;"Corporal, is Carey badly
hurt?"</p>

<p>"He grumbles a good deal, sir, but I think it is
more from anger than pain."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you had better take a man in his place
and let him go to the fort with us, so that the doctor
can look at his arm," said the captain.</p>

<p>"I tell you there is nothing like having friends
at court," said Bob as he and George walked away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
"Until you came among us I didn't know that
these officers could be so very friendly and good-natured.
Why, George, if I knew the country as
well as you do, and could get scout's pay, I would
stay in the army all my life. We have got a sort
of roving commission now, and I hope we can
do something with it before we go back to the
fort."</p>

<p>Details for such duties as this which had just
been assigned to Corporal Owens are about the
only recreations that fall to the lot of a private
soldier on the Plains, and they are eagerly sought
after. Being almost always commanded by a sergeant
or corporal who has proved to the satisfaction
of his superiors that he can be trusted, the
men never fail to enjoy themselves to the fullest
extent. It is a great relief to them to be entirely
out of reach of their Argus-eyed officers, who are
so prompt to take them to task for the least neglect
of duty.</p>

<p>When they reached the place where the Brindles
were encamped, they found that Carey had been
successful in his mission. He had brought Mr.
Wentworth and his boys back with him, and the
troopers were crowded about them listening to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
Sheldon's account of his experience among the
Kiowas.</p>

<p>"Get all you can out of them, boys," exclaimed
Bob, "for you will not see them after to-night."</p>

<p>"Why won't we?" asked half a dozen troopers
at once.</p>

<p>"Because they are not going to the fort. They
are going to Holmes's ranche, wherever that is, and
we're going to see them safely there with the stock."</p>

<p>"We? who?"</p>

<p>"Our same old squad&mdash;all except Carey."</p>

<p>The owner of that name, whose face had lighted
up with pleasure, jumped to his feet with an angry
exclamation. "What do you mean by that, corporal?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"It's no fault of mine, Carey," replied Bob.
"The captain thinks you had better go to the fort,
so that the doctor can look at your wound."</p>

<p>Carey made no reply, but elbowed his way
through the crowd and started toward the other
end of the camp. In a few minutes he was standing
in front of Captain Clinton with his hand to
his cap.</p>

<p>"What is it, Carey?" asked that officer after he
had returned the salute.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>"My respects to you, sir," answered the trooper,
"and, if I might take the liberty, I'd like to know
why I am to be left behind while the rest of our
squad goes off on a picnic with them cattle?"</p>

<p>"Why, you are wounded," said the captain.</p>

<p>"Just a little scratch, sir," protested the trooper.
"But even if I had no right arm at all, I could
ride and shoot, and when it came to yelling I'd be
there too."</p>

<p>"Very good. If you think you can stand it,
go on."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. I knew you wouldn't go back
on old Carey. I've been in every muss my troop
has been in, and nobody ever hinted that I didn't
do my duty."</p>

<p>The captain nodded his head and waved his hand
in token of dismissal, and the trooper hurried away.</p>

<p>Up to this time George Ackerman had always
messed with the officers, but that night he took
supper with Bob's squad, because both he and they
considered that he belonged to it. During the
progress of the meal he reminded the corporal that
the latter had promised to tell him a story.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Bob, after thinking a moment.
"I was telling you, I believe, that if Mr. Went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>worth
killed that Indian he would be arrested and
tried for murder. Well, that's an Indian's idea of
justice, and it seems to be the agents' idea too.
The Indians think they have a perfect right to
kill and scalp whenever they feel like it, but if a
white man kills one of them it is an awful thing.
If they can't get hold of the man who did the
shooting or any of his relations, they look to the
government for pay. On a certain occasion a
scouting-party of ten men was surprised and utterly
wiped out. The surprise was so complete
that every one of the party was killed at the first
fire, with the exception of a corporal, who had just
time to knock over two of the reds before he too
was shot. Shortly afterward a peace was patched
up, and a band of braves came in, bringing with
them an old woman for whom they asked a government
pension because her two sons had fallen
in battle. Inquiries were made, and it turned out
that these two sons were the very Indians who had
been killed by the corporal. What do you think
of such impudence?"</p>

<p>George did not know what to think of it, and
probably the reader doesn't either; but this very
incident is on record.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>By daylight the next morning the camp was
deserted. The main body of the troops was riding
rapidly toward Fort Lamoine, and a few miles
behind it came the herd which Captain Clinton
had recaptured. It was moving leisurely along in
front of Mr. Wentworth and George, who controlled
it with less difficulty than the rest of the
squad would have experienced in managing a dozen
cattle. Behind them came Bob and his men, with
the two boys, who were mounted on a couple of
their father's horses which had been found with
the herd. George's quick eye had already noticed
that there were at least half a dozen different
brands among the cattle, and he told himself that
when the animals bearing these brands had been
delivered up to their lawful owners, Mr. Wentworth
would have very little stock left.</p>

<p>Bob and his troopers enjoyed this "picnic" by
being lazy. They had nothing to do worth speaking
of but to follow along in the rear of the herd
and talk to the boys, the most of the work being
performed by George and Mr. Wentworth, who
during the first part of the journey managed the
cattle both day and night. They offered to assist
in any way they could, but the practised herders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
did not need them, and besides, they were afraid
to trust them.</p>

<p>"I don't want to lose these steers and horses
again, after all the trouble I have had to get
them," Mr. Wentworth always replied. "I know
you are good soldiers, or else you couldn't have
got my boys back for me; but you can't herd
cattle. The least awkward movement on your
part would send them galloping back toward the
Staked Plains again. Wait until they get over
their fright, and then you can try your hands at
guarding them during the night."</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the fifth day Bob noticed
that George's field-glass was often brought into
requisition both by himself and Mr. Wentworth,
and on riding forward to inquire the cause of it,
he was informed that they were looking for Mr.
Taylor's ranche.</p>

<p>"And who is Mr. Taylor?" was Bob's next
question.</p>

<p>"He is one of Mr. Wentworth's neighbors who
was raided by the Indians. We know it, for we
have some of his cattle with us; but whether or
not they did him any damage beyond stealing his
stock, we don't know; and we can't tell, either,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
until we find his house if it is still standing, or
the ruins of it if it has been destroyed."</p>

<p>"Then we must be getting pretty near our journey's
end," said Bob, whose arms and shoulders
began to ache when he thought of the tedious routine
of drill and guard-duty upon which he must
enter as soon as he returned to the fort.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean by <i>near</i>," replied
George. "The fort is all of a hundred and fifty
miles from here, and we are not going toward it.
We are going toward Holmes's ranche; and even
if we have the best of luck, it will take us two
weeks to get there."</p>

<p>"That sounds better," said Bob, who was greatly
relieved. "When you spoke of Mr. Wentworth's
neighbors, I was afraid that our pleasure-excursion
was about to be brought to an end, for he doesn't
live so <i>very</i> far from the fort, you know."</p>

<p>"It's just over there," shouted Mr. Wentworth
at this moment. "I see cattle, and that proves
that the raiders didn't scoop Taylor as they did
me. Now look sharp; we've got rounding out
enough to do already."</p>

<p>"What does he mean by that?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"He means that we mustn't allow our cattle to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
mix in with Mr. Taylor's, for if we do we shall
have to round them all out again. By 'rounding
out' we mean separating the different herds from
each other; and that is something that none but
good herdsmen can do. It requires skill and a big
stock of patience, I tell you. Just let a few green
hands try it, and see how much they would make
at it. Why, they would scare the cattle so that
they would run clear out of the State."</p>

<p>Although Mr. Wentworth had declared that Mr.
Taylor's ranche was "just over there," our friends
did not reach it that day, nor until late in the
afternoon of the next. Before they got there they
knew just what Mr. Taylor's experience with the
Kiowa raiders had been, for they had passed two
or three of his herds, whose keepers had told them
all about it. The Indians had suddenly made
their appearance, coming from the south, and driving
before them a large number of cattle; and although
they had not come within five miles of
Mr. Taylor's ranche, they had picked up one of
his small herds which happened to be in their
path.</p>

<p>Our friends camped that night close by Mr.
Taylor's ranche, which proved to be a perfect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
little fort. It was built of heavy stone, was well
supplied with provisions, and defended by five
stalwart fellows who were armed with Winchester
rifles. The raiders would have had a nice time
of it if they had come there. The owner listened
in great surprise to Mr. Wentworth's story, made
much of his boys, and would not let him and
George "round out" the stock that bore his brand.</p>

<p>"You're welcome to the steers, neighbor," said
he. "I've got more left than I can take care of
if the Kiowas bounce me as earnestly as they did
you, and you will need them to help you start a
new herd."</p>

<p>This same thing was repeated by every one of
the half a dozen other ranchemen to whom Mr.
Wentworth offered to surrender their stock. They
all sympathized with him, and wanted to aid him
by every means in their power. The result was,
that our friends arrived within one day's march of
their journey's end with just as many cattle as they
had when they left the Staked Plains. Although
Mr. Wentworth had been "completely cleaned
out," he was still worth something like twenty
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>George and his party made their last camp a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
short distance from the cabin of a squatter, who
rode over to see them during the evening. He
went home about ten o'clock, and George and his
companions lay down on their blankets, leaving
the herd to the care of four mounted troopers.
The latter, who during the journey had exhibited
the greatest eagerness to learn something of the
mysteries of cattle-herding, had so far progressed
in knowledge and skill as to be able to stand guard
at night, and to give George and Mr. Wentworth
an opportunity to obtain the rest of which they
began to stand so much in need. About midnight
George mounted his horse and rode around the
herd to assure himself that everything was just
as it should be. He went on horseback, because
everybody rides while working about Texas cattle.
If a man should venture among them on foot during
the daytime, his life would be in danger; and
if he went around them at night, he would probably
stampede the whole herd.</p>

<p>"All serene," said Loring, who was the first
guard George encountered during his rounds.
"The moon shines so brightly that I can see the
movements of every steer in the drove."</p>

<p>"If we were a little nearer the river perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
things wouldn't be quite so serene," answered
George. "The Mexicans take just such a night
as this for their raids."</p>

<p>About an hour after George had retired to his
blanket Loring noticed that the cattle began to
show signs of uneasiness. Those that were standing
up began to move about, those that were lying
down arose and moved about with them, and presently
the whole herd was in motion. The cattle
did not attempt to run away, but walked restlessly
about, as if they were unable to find a place that
suited them.</p>

<p>"Suke, thing! suke, thing!" said Loring coaxingly.</p>

<p>The travelled reader would have said at once
that Loring was a Southerner; and if he could
have heard Phillips on the other side of the cattle
trying to soothe them with "Co-boss! co-boss!"
he would have said that Phillips was from the
North. But the cattle did not understand either
of them, or if they did they paid no attention to
them. Their restlessness increased every moment,
and finally Loring, good soldier though he was, deserted
his post and started for camp as fast as he
could make his horse walk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ackerman," said he in an excited voice, "get
up. There is something wrong with those cattle."</p>

<p>George was on his feet in an instant. One
glance at the herd was enough.</p>

<p>"I should say there was something wrong!" he
exclaimed. "How long has this thing been going
on?"</p>

<p>"Not more than five minutes."</p>

<p>"Which way are they looking," continued
George.</p>

<p>"Every way, but the most of them keep their
heads in that direction," said Loring, waving his
arm toward the south.</p>

<p>"Call everybody in camp while I speak to Bob
and Mr. Wentworth. No noise now. I am afraid
we are going to have trouble."</p>

<p>In less than two minutes all the troopers had
been aroused, and George was holding an earnest
consultation with Mr. Wentworth and the corporal.
"I've seen cattle act that way before," said he,
speaking as rapidly as he could make his tongue
move, for time was precious; "and if we were a
little nearer the river I could easily tell what is
the matter with them; but I never heard of the
Greasers coming so far into the country as this, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
it may be nothing but nervousness that's troubling
them. My advice would be to mount the men and
move them quietly in line on the north side of the
herd, and perhaps by making such a show of numbers
we can keep them within bounds until they
are quieted down.&mdash;What do you say, Mr. Wentworth?"</p>

<p>"It is the only thing that can be done," replied
Mr. Wentworth, who seemed to be greatly excited
and alarmed; "and even that is a slim chance.&mdash;Make
haste, corporal. Do all you can for me, for
if I lose this herd I shall be ruined, sure enough."</p>

<p>"Catch up!" commanded Bob.</p>

<p>"Look here," said George, seizing his friend by
the shoulder and speaking with all the earnestness
he could throw into his tones: "if you get in line
in front of those cattle, and they start to run toward
you, don't try to stop them, for you can't do
it, any more than we could stop those buffaloes the
other night. Run before them, and gradually draw
off to the right or left of them, and you will get
safely off; otherwise they will certainly run over
you. But I am afraid it is too late to do anything,"
added George as he noted the increasing
restlessness of the cattle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is too late! it is too late!" exclaimed Mr.
Wentworth, rubbing his hands nervously together.
"There they go!"</p>

<p>Even as he spoke a noise like the rumbling of
distant thunder sounded in their ears, and instantly
the whole herd made off at the top of its speed.
Looking over the mass of horns and tails that was
tossed wildly in the air, the troopers were horrified
to see Phillips standing directly in front of it.
Being fully determined to do his duty to the utmost,
the brave fellow sat in his saddle, swinging
his arms about his head, and no doubt shouting at
the top of his voice to stop the advance of the
frightened herd, which was bearing down upon
him with the resistless power of an avalanche.</p>

<p>"The man is crazy!" cried George in great
alarm. Then, raising both hands to his face and
using them as a speaking-trumpet, he yelled, with
all the power of his lungs,</p>

<p>"Run! run for your life!"</p>

<p>Phillips afterward said that he did not hear what
George said to him&mdash;in fact, he couldn't hear anything
but the noise of those hoofs&mdash;but, seeing that
if he remained where he was his death was certain,
he wheeled his horse and fled with the speed of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
wind. The last his friends saw of him was as he
dashed over the top of a ridge, with the stampeded
cattle close behind him. When they were all out
of sight and the rumble of their hoofs had died
away in the distance, the troopers turned to look
at Mr. Wentworth. He stood with his hands in
his pockets gazing disconsolately in the direction
in which the herd had disappeared, but had nothing
to say.</p>

<p>"Now, here's a go!" whispered Bob, giving
George a nudge in the ribs with his elbow.
"What am I to do? This is something Captain
Clinton didn't think to provide for, isn't it? I
was ordered to go to Holmes's ranche with Mr.
Wentworth, but I wasn't told to follow up and
collect his cattle if they were stampeded."</p>

<p>"You mustn't think of following them up,"
said George decidedly. "There is no man in the
world who could get that same herd together again,
for it will join others as soon as it gets over its
fright; and how could we tell these cattle from
others bearing the same brand? They are gone,
and that's all there is of it. You must mount at
once and see if you can find anything of Phillips."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right!&mdash;Mr. Wentworth," said Bob, "we
are very sorry for the loss you have sustained, but
we have done all we could for you."</p>

<p>"I know it, corporal, and I am very grateful to
you and to the captain, who was kind enough to
send you with me. Such things as these will happen
sometimes, in spite of everything. Now I
hardly know what to do."</p>

<p>Neither would anybody else have known what
to do under the same circumstances. Mr. Wentworth
had no home, no property except his rifle
and the horses he and his boys rode, no work to
do, and but little to eat in his haversack. It was
a trying situation for a man who but a few days
before had been worth a fortune, and almost any
one would have been disheartened.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what you can do," said George.
"You can easily find your way to the Ackerman
settlement, and if you go there and give Mr. Gilbert
a note of introduction which I will write for
you, he will take care of you until you can decide
upon something."</p>

<p>George did not feel at liberty to tell Mr. Wentworth
all he had on his mind. As soon as he returned
to the fort he intended to write to his guar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>dian,
asking him if he might furnish Mr. Wentworth
with a sufficient number of cattle from his
own herds to give the impoverished man a new
start in life. Of course Mr. Wentworth had a few
cattle of his own among those that had just run off,
but it would take some time to gather them up;
and as he would not want to be troubled with his
boys while he was engaged in the work, George intended
to ask Mr. Gilbert to take care of them
during their father's absence, and to lend Mr.
Wentworth a few good herdsmen to assist him in
getting his stock together. While he was thinking
about it, and before Mr. Wentworth could thank
him for his generous offer, something happened
which told them very plainly that the stampede
that had just taken place was not owing to the
nervousness of the cattle, but to the presence of
those of whom George Ackerman had every reason
to stand in fear.</p>

<p>Their attention was first attracted by some unusual
sound. They could not have told what it
was or from which direction it came, but they all
heard it, and waited for it to be repeated, that they
might locate and define it. There was a moment's
silence, and then a chorus of wild yells arose on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
the night air, accompanied by the rapid discharge
of firearms. The troopers looked at one another
in blank amazement, and then at George, who was
not long in assigning a cause for the disturbance.</p>

<p>"The Greasers are attacking the squatter," he
exclaimed; and he was quite as much astonished
to be called upon to say it as the troopers were to
hear it. It must be a strong and daring band that
would venture so far into the country, and almost
involuntarily George whispered the name of Fletcher.
Bob was quick to decide upon his course. He
knew just what Captain Clinton would expect of
him if he were there.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wentworth," said he, "we must lend that
man a helping hand. As you can't go with us on
account of your boys, you will have to look out
for yourself and them."</p>

<p>"And I am just the man who can do it," replied
Mr. Wentworth. "Good-bye and good luck
to you! Shoot hard, and shoot to hit."</p>

<p>"How cool and confident he is! I wish I had
half his courage," thought Bob as he ordered his
men into their saddles, following it up with the
commands, "Forward! Trot! gallop!"</p>

<p>The troopers fell into line as they moved off, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
a few yards in advance of them rode George and
Bob. The former could easily have taken the lead
if he had desired to do so, but, knowing that he did
not command the squad, he curbed his impatience as
well as he could and kept close by his friend's side.
The troopers unslung their carbines, George made
ready his Winchester, while Bob, who believed as
firmly in the virtues of "cold steel" as did the
gallant officer whom he afterward accompanied on
his last memorable march, drew his sabre. All on
a sudden the firing ceased, and when the troopers
rode over the brow of a ridge a few minutes later,
they saw a thin blue smoke arising from the squatter's
cabin, and that told them more than they wanted
to know. George was both astonished and enraged
at the sight&mdash;astonished to know that the
raiders would stop during one of their marauding
expeditions, when haste was so necessary, to attack
and burn so humble a dwelling as the abode of the
squatter, and enraged to see that they had been successful
enough to do even that. There was a crowd
of Mexicans around the building, and others with
horses were standing close by.</p>

<p>"Gobble the horses, Bob," said George, who was
so highly excited that he could scarcely speak, "and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
then you can ride down and capture the raiders at
your leisure."</p>

<p>Bob caught the idea in an instant. Turning in
his saddle, he waved his sabre over his head, but
instead of giving the command "Charge!" he effectually
closed the mouths of his followers, who
had already opened their lips and drawn in a long
breath preparatory to giving vent to their favorite
yell, by saying in a low tone, "Silence!"</p>

<p>Bob did not know whether or not this order
had ever before been given during a charge, and,
what was more, he did not care. His object was
to cut the men who were lingering about the burning
cabin off from their horses, and in order to do
that he must get as close as he could to them before
he was discovered.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">TOP</a></span>
<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>


<p>The men about the cabin were so engrossed in
their work of destruction, and the horse-guards
were so intent on watching them, that Bob's advance
was not discovered until he and his followers
were within less than two hundred yards of the
cabin. So entirely unexpected was their appearance
that for a moment the cattle-thieves were
struck motionless with astonishment; then they
recovered their power of action, and those who
were on foot made a rush for their horses. Some
succeeded in reaching them, but others did not.
Two or three of them fell before the carbines of
the troopers, who opened a hot fire as soon as they
saw that they were discovered, and the horse-guards,
believing that the attacking party was backed up by
a large force of soldiers which was close at hand,
instantly put spurs to their nags and galloped off,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
taking the loose horses with them and leaving their
companions to look out for themselves.</p>

<p>"Throw down and throw up, Greasers!" commanded
Corporal Owens as he dashed up to the
cabin swinging his sabre over his head; and the
order, which meant, "Throw down your weapons
and throw up your hands," was obeyed by five
sullen fellows, who muttered Spanish oaths between
their teeth and looked mad enough to do
almost anything.</p>

<p>There was no fight at all. If there had been
a shot fired at the troopers, they didn't know it.
The party that had gone off with the horses outnumbered
Bob's, and could, beyond a doubt, have
driven them off the field if they had only thought
so; but their surprise was complete, and, more than
that, they were demoralized. The presence of the
troopers they regarded as part of a pre-concerted
plan to cut them off from the river, and that
frightened them more than Bob's sudden onslaught.</p>

<p>"Still another feather for your cap, Corporal
Owens," said George, after he and Loring and a
few others had taken a shot or two apiece at the
retreating cattle-thieves, "and nobody hurt on our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
side, either. Now I&mdash;What are you doing here?
Is this the way you keep your promise?"</p>

<p>These questions were addressed to one of the
prisoners, who took off his sombrero and scratched
his head as if he were trying to stir up his ideas so
that he could make some reply to these peremptory
interrogations.</p>

<p>"Springer," continued George, slowly, "what are
you doing here? Where's the squatter?"</p>

<p>"In there," replied the cattle-thief, jerking his
head toward the cabin, which was now fairly ablaze
and sending out so much heat that the troopers
were obliged to draw away from it. "He never
would have touched him, Fletcher wouldn't, if he
had kept in the house an' left us alone; but he
plumped one of us over when we fust came up;
an' this here is the consequence," added Springer,
nodding his head toward the cabin again.</p>

<p>George knew why it was that the cattle-thieves
had stopped to destroy the squatter's house. He
had killed one of their number, and they, in turn,
had killed him after a hard fight, and it was now
too late to recover his body or to save a single
thing the cabin contained.</p>

<p>"So this is the fellow who twice befriended you,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
is it?" said Bob, who was surprised to hear George
call one of the prisoners by name. "Don't you
think it would be a good plan to chuck him into
the fire too?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> do," said Loring fiercely.</p>

<p>Springer drew a little nearer to George for protection.</p>

<p>"I didn't have any hand in it," said he earnestly&mdash;"honor
bright, I didn't. I can explain
everything, so that you can see that I am not to
blame for being here."</p>

<p>"Carey," exclaimed Bob, "go back to Mr.
Wentworth and give him his choice between taking
care of himself and going to the fort with us.
Hurry up, now.&mdash;If I only had a spade or two, I
would make these prisoners bury their dead comrades."</p>

<p>"Springer," said George, "can these friends of
yours understand English?"</p>

<p>The cattle-thief replied that they could not; they
were all Mexicans.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it, for I want to ask you a
few questions before you explain how you came to
be here. Did Fletcher have his whole band with
him to-night?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not half of 'em," was the reply; "he had only
about thirty men."</p>

<p>"How many has he in all?"</p>

<p>"Two hundred or so."</p>

<p>"Does he still make his head-quarters at the
Don's ranche?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but look here, Mr. George," said Springer
earnestly; "if you are goin' over there after him,
be mighty careful. You know what sort of a looking
place that ranche is&mdash;all stone, you know&mdash;an'
them fellows is all old soldiers, an' they'll fight
awful."</p>

<p>George nodded his head as if to say that he
knew all about that, and spent some minutes in
questioning the prisoner in regard to the road that
led to the ranche, while Bob sat by on his horse
and listened. By the time George had heard all
he wanted to know, and Springer had told how he
had been arrested by the officer at Eagle Pass and
rescued by Fletcher, Carey came back.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wentworth will take care of himself,"
reported the trooper. "He says that if he went to
the fort he would have to come back to Holmes's
ranche, anyway&mdash;he is going to make his home
there for a while, for he and Holmes were boys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
together&mdash;and so he might just as well go there in
the first place, and save time and travelling. He
sent his best wishes to everybody, and hopes we
will catch all the scoundrels who wiped out the
squatter."</p>

<p>"I wish we could," said Bob, facing about in his
saddle and gazing in the direction in which the
thieves had retreated; "but we have five prisoners
to take care of, and so our hands are tied."</p>

<p>"You just ought to have seen him, corporal,"
continued Carey. "He had thrown his three
horses in a sort of triangle by tying their feet
together and tripping them up in some way, and
there he lay with his boys behind his living breastworks,
all ready for a fight. Grit to the last,
wasn't he? When I asked him why he hadn't
mounted and dug out as soon as we left, he said
that that wouldn't have been safe, for he might
have run right in among the Greasers before he
knew it."</p>

<p>"Well, boys," said Bob, gazing sorrowfully at
the glowing bed of coals that covered the site
of the squatter's cabin, "there is nothing more
we can do here, and so we will make a break
for the fort."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look here, corporal," said one of the troopers:
"if you are going to make us carry double with
those dirty Greasers, I am going to kick."</p>

<p>"Don't you worry," answered Bob. "I shouldn't
do it myself, and of course I sha'n't ask you to do
it. They'll have to walk.&mdash;Springer, draw these
Mexican gentlemen up in line."</p>

<p>Springer gave the necessary order in Spanish,
and it was sullenly obeyed.</p>

<p>"Just remind them, Springer, that if they don't
step faster than that somebody may hasten their
movements with a prod from the point of a sabre,"
said Bob angrily. "We are in no humor to stand
a great deal of nonsense from them. Now, right-face
them; that's better.&mdash;Fall in around them,
squad, four on each flank and four in the rear.
Forward, march!&mdash;Now, George, which way is
the fort from here?"</p>

<p>"Off there," replied George, "but I am going
to take you to the river-trail."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"So that you can get something to eat."</p>

<p>If they had been a little farther down the river,
say about twenty-five miles, George would have
taken them to his own house. It would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
given him no little pleasure to entertain these
companions of a long, toilsome and dangerous
scout under his own roof; but of course he could
not think of leading them out of their way in
order to do it. They found plenty to eat after
they reached the river-trail, but the ranchemen at
whose houses they halted could give them no
information concerning the raiders. They had
been on that side of the river, and had gone
back empty-handed, and that was all the ranchemen
knew about the matter. This made it plain
that Bob's gallant dash had not been without its
effect. It had frightened the thieves so thoroughly
that they dared not stop to pick up any of the
cattle they found in their way.</p>

<p>Bob and his troopers camped that night near
a farm-house whose owner was so delighted to see
the five prisoners they had brought with them, and
to learn of the success that had attended them ever
since Captain Clinton sent them off by themselves,
that he insisted on giving them a seat at his table.
The next morning he gave them a breakfast; but
the first squad who went in&mdash;which included Bob
and George&mdash;had scarcely taken possession of their
chairs when one of the sentries was heard calling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
lustily for the corporal of the guard. Bob excused
himself and ran out, only to return again almost
immediately and startle everybody with the order,
"Boots and saddles!" George jumped up from the
table, wondering what was the matter. When he
reached the porch he found out. About a mile up
the trail was a long column of blue-coats coming
down at a sweeping trot.</p>

<p>"They are our boys, and they are after the
Greasers," exclaimed Bob, as George came down
the steps. "It's lucky we are here, for you are
the very man they want if they are going across
the river.&mdash;Catch up, boys, and fall in just as we
do when we are on the march, only face to the
left, so as to front the column when it comes
up."</p>

<p>If we have a reader who is familiar with cavalry
tactics, he will have discovered, long before
this time, that Corporal Owens was not at all particular
as to the orders he gave, provided he could
make his men act to suit him. When in the
presence of his superiors he always gave the
proper commands, in order to save himself from
the reproof that would have promptly followed
the slightest departure from the tactics; but when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
he was in command of a scouting-party he was
decidedly free and easy. Even an old trooper
might have been puzzled over this last order, but
the men who had marched with him so many
miles were quick to catch his meaning and prompt
to carry out his wishes; so that when the whole
available cavalry force of Fort Lamoine, numbering
two hundred men, came sweeping by the
farm-house a few minutes later, with Captain Clinton
riding at the head, they were astonished to see
Bob's little squad drawn up in a hollow square,
with their prisoners in the centre. Of late there
had been a good many anxious inquiries made
concerning these very men, and here they were,
safe and sound, and, wonderful to tell, with more
prisoners to show what good soldiers they were.</p>

<p>"Three cheers for the 'Brindles,' the old reliables!"
shouted the sergeant-major; and the yells
that arose from two hundred pairs of strong lungs
could have been heard a long distance away.</p>

<p>George lifted his cap in response to a nod of recognition
from Captain Clinton, and in obedience to
a sign from him rode over to his side; but Bob
and his men sat in their saddles as stiff as so
many posts, looking straight to the front. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
the next call for cheers came, however, it almost
knocked Bob over.</p>

<p>"Three cheers for Sergeant Owens!" shouted a
"Brindle;" and then came three more yells, followed
by a "tiger" as loud and piercing as an
Indian war-whoop. During his absence Bob had
been promoted in general orders for gallantry, his
pay as sergeant to begin on the day he rescued Mr.
Wentworth's boys from the hands of the Kiowas.</p>

<p>Presently the bugle sounded, and the column
came to a halt. The officers at once fell out and
crowded around George, who, in as few words as
possible, told Captain Clinton what Bob's squad
had been doing since the captain left them back
there on the borders of the Staked Plains. The
officers were all very much pleased, especially Lieutenant
Earle, who for a moment threw off his dignity
and rode up to thank the members of the
squad which had brought so much credit upon
the troop he commanded.</p>

<p>"Sergeant," said he, extending his hand&mdash;which
Bob accepted after running his own hand through
his sword-knot and dropping his sabre by his side&mdash;"I
congratulate you and all your men. You
have done well."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob managed to stammer out something about
being glad to have pleased the lieutenant, and the
latter, after ordering them to sheathe their sabres,
went on to tell how he had followed the Indians
in his front until his men and horses were nearly
exhausted and almost dead for want of water, and
how he had finally returned to the fort a day behind
the column, utterly disgusted with his want
of success, to find that some of his own troop had
carried off the honors of the scout. He was proud
to command such men.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Captain Clinton and George were
engaged in an earnest consultation. The former
told the young scout that he been sent out to
punish the raiders who had just recrossed the river,
and that he was going to do it, too. He was going
to drive them out of their stronghold, and George
must show him the way to it. His men had already
had their coffee, but as George and the rest
of Bob's squad had had none, they might stay there
at the farm-house until they had eaten the breakfast
that had been prepared for them, and then ride
on rapidly and overtake the column, which would
move down the trail at a trot. This having been
decided upon, a squad was made up of details from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
the different companies to take charge of the prisoners,
and the command given to a corporal, who
was instructed to take them to the fort. Then the
column rode on, the corporal marched off with
his captives, and Bob and his troopers went back
to the farm-house to eat their breakfast.</p>

<p>During the meal George Ackerman, who had
thus far been one of the gayest of the party, was
very silent and thoughtful. It was almost impossible
for any one to get a word out of him. His
face was as white as a sheet, but although everybody
noticed it, Bob Owens was the only one who
could account for it. When they had satisfied
their appetites they went out to hold the horses,
so that the rest of the squad could come in, and
George and the new sergeant, who was not a little
elated over his unexpected promotion, led their
nags off on one side, so that they could converse
without being overheard.</p>

<p>"I know just how it is," said Bob, "for I have
felt so ever since Captain Clinton ordered me to
follow up that trail. When you know that a good
many lives besides your own depend upon a decision
you may have to make in an instant of
time, I tell you it is rather trying to a fellow's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
nerves. I used to envy the colonel and all the
other high officers in the garrison, but I wouldn't
give up my little sergeant's berth for double the
money they make. There's too much responsibility
connected with the positions they hold."</p>

<p>George told himself that that was just the objection
to his own position. He began to see that
being a scout meant something. There were two
hundred men in Captain Clinton's command, and
what if they should all be sacrificed by some blunder
on his part?</p>

<p>As soon as the rest of the troopers had eaten
breakfast, and Bob had thanked the farmer for his
hospitality, the troopers sprang into their saddles
and galloped after the column. When they overtook
it George rode up beside the captain, and the
Brindles, without creating the least confusion, fell
into their usual places&mdash;all except Bob Owens, who
did not belong in the ranks any longer. Being second
sergeant, his place was in the rear of his company,
"opposite the left file of the rear four;" and
that was the position he fell into as soon as he had
reported the arrival of his squad to the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Well, Ackerman," said Captain Clinton as the
boy galloped up beside him, "we are in your hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
We want to go to the nearest ford, and we don't
want to get there before dark."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir. If you will move the column
in that direction," said George, indicating a 'right
oblique,' "you will cut off twenty miles, and besides,
you can walk all the way, and save your
horses for a rapid eighteen-mile ride that must
come as soon as we cross the river."</p>

<p>We need not dwell upon the incidents of that
day's march, or enlarge upon the feeling of suspense
that George Ackerman experienced during
that "rapid eighteen-mile ride" to which he had
referred. It will be enough to say that they crossed
the ford just after dark in safety; that George,
without the least difficulty, found the narrow road
that led from the river to Don Miguel's ranche;
that at his suggestion the column marched "right
by twos," which changed the troopers from four to
two abreast, Captain Clinton and George riding at
the head; that they moved as silently as possible,
so as not to alarm any of the people living along
the route, and rapidly, in order to reach the ranche
before the cattle-thieves could receive notice of
their approach; and that at the end of two hours
they galloped into the valley and saw Fletcher's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
stronghold in plain view before them. A single
glance at it showed them that they had arrived
just in the nick of time. The courtyard was
lighted up with lanterns, excited men were moving
to and fro, loud voices were heard shouting out
words of command, and the whole interior of the
building presented a scene of the wildest commotion.
Some watchful friend had got ahead of the column
and warned the thieves, and they were gathering
up their plunder preparatory to beating a hasty retreat.
They were on the watch too, for the column
had scarcely made its appearance when a sentry
called out, "Who is it?" (equivalent to "Who goes
there?"), following up his challenge with the cry
of "The Americans! the Americans!"</p>

<p>George afterward said that he never had a very
clear idea of what happened during the next few
minutes. He remembered that he heard the bugle
sound a charge; that he dashed through the arched
stone gateway at headlong speed side by side with
Captain Clinton; and that the rapid discharge of
firearms rang in his ears, accompanied by the cries
of the cattle-thieves, who fled in every direction,
and such cheers and yells from the troopers as he
had never heard before. When he came to himself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
his horse, which seemed to enter fully into the spirit
of the matter, was dancing about in front of a
pile of forage that filled one end of the courtyard.
When George saw it he threw himself from his
saddle and caught up a lantern.</p>

<p>"I have seen the inside of this hole for the last
time," said he to himself. "If Fletcher lives to
make a prisoner of me, he shall not bring me to
this ranche, and neither shall he harbor here to
raid on my stock."</p>

<p>As these thoughts passed through the boy's mind
he smashed the glass globe of the lantern with one
savage kick, and picking up the lamp applied the
flame to the pile of forage. He set it on fire in
half a dozen different places, and then turned and
threw the lamp into one of the nearest rooms, which
seemed to be well filled with something. When he
had done that he was frightened. What if it was
powder in there? But, fortunately, it wasn't. It
was some combustible matter that blazed up fiercely,
sending huge volumes of flames out of the door
and lighting up the courtyard, which was now occupied
only by American troopers. The cattle-thieves
had behaved just as they did when Bob
Owens so gallantly attacked a portion of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
number at the squatter's cabin. They fled in hot
haste, making their escape by the roof, by doors
whose existence George never dreamed of, and by
squeezing themselves through the narrow openings
that served the ranche in the place of windows.
And, strange to tell, there was no one injured on
either side. Having satisfied himself on this point
by searching all the rooms to make sure that there
were no dead or wounded men in them, the captain
ordered his troopers into the saddle and departed
as rapidly and silently as he had come. George
looked over his shoulder now and then, and when
he saw the thick clouds of smoke that arose in the
air growing thicker and blacker, he told himself
that he had made sure work of the old ranche, and
that it would never serve the cattle-thieves for a
harboring-place again.</p>

<p>Of course there was an "investigation" made by
the Mexican government, but if it ever amounted
to anything, George never heard of it. The expedition
certainly had a moral effect, and no doubt that
was just what the department commander wanted.
A body of Mexican troops was ordered to the river
almost immediately, and after that the raiders were
by no means as bold as they had formerly been.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
They crossed the Rio Grande now and then lower
down, toward Eagle Pass, but the troopers there
were on the alert, and after they had thrashed the
thieves a few times on their own ground, and some
of their leaders had been arrested by the Mexican
authorities, the Texans began to feel comparatively
safe.</p>

<p>George Ackerman was kept actively employed
at the fort much longer than he thought he would
be when he first went there. By order of Colonel
Brown he crossed the river on several occasions disguised
in his Mexican suit, and he always brought
back some information concerning the raiders; and
once he came so near being captured by his old
enemy, Fletcher, that it was a wonder how he escaped.
But long before this happened Gus Robbins
had received his discharge as a minor, and
gone back to Foxboro', a wiser if not a happier
boy; Bristow had found his way into the military
prison at Fort Leavenworth; and the cattle-thieves
whom Bob Owens had captured at the squatter's
cabin had been turned over to the civil authorities.
George did all he could to secure Springer's release,
but his efforts were unavailing, and with his
companions he was sentenced to the penitentiary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
for a long term of years. Mr. Wentworth had
come out all right. With the aid of his friend,
Mr. Holmes, he had gathered up all his cattle that
had been stampeded by the Mexican raiders, and rebuilt
his ranche in a more substantial manner, and
he and his boys made it a point to visit the post
very frequently to see the men who had rendered
them such signal service.</p>

<p>The months wore on, the raids in Colonel Brown's
district grew less and less frequent until they ceased
altogether, and then the colonel told George that he
might go home if he so desired. He did desire it,
for he was growing tired of life among the soldiers,
and besides, he knew it would be a waste of time
for him to remain at the fort when he could no
longer be of any use there. So, after taking leave
of the officers and of the men who had accompanied
him on his expeditions, he mounted his horse,
took his pack-mule by the halter and set out.
The troopers, who had assembled at the gate to see
him go, cheered him lustily as he rode through
their ranks, and George carried away with him the
assurance that their feelings toward him were very
unlike those with which they had regarded him
when he first made his appearance at the fort.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<p>Sergeant Owens never lost the position he held
in the estimation of both officers and men. He
did his duty faithfully, never squandered a cent
of his pay at the sutler's store, and at last had
the satisfaction of telling himself that he had refunded
every cent of the <i>Mail Carrier's</i> money, interest
included. He kept up a regular correspondence
with his father, who told him he was proud
of the record he had won, and said everything he
could to encourage him. One thing that pleased
Bob was the knowledge of the fact that everybody
in and about Rochdale was familiar with his history.
They knew just what he had done when the steamer
Sam Kendall was burned, and the particulars of
his exploit on the Staked Plains had been published
in the papers. He would go home a hero,
instead of sneaking back like a thief in the night;
and that is something that runaway boys don't
often do.</p>

<p>George Ackerman was glad to get back to his
ranche again. He thoroughly enjoyed the quiet
life he led there, it was so different from the life
of bustle and excitement he had led at the fort.
One bright moonlight night, while he was pacing
up and down the porch, thinking over old times,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
and wondering what Bob Owens and the rest of
the boys were doing at the fort, he was aroused
from the reverie into which he had fallen by the
sound of horses' hoofs on the trail. He stopped
abruptly, and after listening a moment heard the
clanking of sabres mingling with the sound of
the horses' feet. Greatly surprised, George descended
the steps, and walking out to the trail
discovered a long line of horsemen approaching.
There was no need that he should ask who they
were or where they came from, for as soon as they
saw him they greeted him vociferously. They
were troopers from Fort Lamoine. They rode on
past the ranche, but two men who were riding at
the head of the column turned off and came up
to him. One was Mr. Gilbert and the other was
Captain Clinton.</p>

<p>"Why, captain," exclaimed George, "this is an
unexpected pleasure. May I ask where you are
going? You'll not march any farther to-night?"</p>

<p>"No, we're not going any farther," was the
answer. "I was about to camp near Mr. Gilbert's
ranche, but when I happened to mention your
name, he told me that you lived only ten miles
away; so I came on, thinking that perhaps you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
would like to see the boys again for the last time.
We're going up to Fort Lincoln to join General
Terry," continued the captain, as he dismounted
and gave his horse up to one of George's herdsmen.
"That's in Dakota, you know. A determined&mdash;and,
I hope, successful&mdash;effort is about to
be made to crush that old rascal, Sitting Bull, by
throwing three strong columns upon him&mdash;one under
Crook from the south, another under Gibbon
from the west, and the third under Terry from the
east. There's where your old friends the 'Brindles'
are going. I suppose it doesn't make any difference
to you where we camp?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," replied George. "There is
plenty of grass and water close at hand. Come
into the house, both of you. I want to hear all
about that great expedition."</p>

<p>Were there not exciting times in the ranche
that night? and didn't George find the greatest
satisfaction in acting as host to the men with whom
he had so often messed at the fort? The supper
was the best the house could afford, and all the
officers in the column sat down to it. When they
had talked themselves out, and were about to go
to camp, George asked and obtained permission<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
for Sergeant Owens and all the members of his
old squad to come in and visit him. Then there
was another supper to be eaten and another long
conversation to be had, and the consequence was
that when reveille was sounded no one in that
ranche had had a wink of sleep.</p>

<p>Bob Owens rode away with his command that
morning, and it was a long time before George
heard of him again. He left Fort Lincoln with
General Terry, went off with Custer on that memorable
scout, and when that officer divided his command
into three detachments, Sergeant Owens was
one of those who were detailed to remain behind
with the packs. He heard all of that terrible
fight on that bright Sunday afternoon when Reno
was defeated and Custer fell with so many of his
devoted followers. He took part in the closing
scenes of it, for when the packs were ordered up,
about six o'clock in the evening, he was under
fire from that time until nine, and saw eighteen
of his companions killed and forty-six wounded.
He marched back to Fort Lincoln with the remnants
of the expedition, which had been whipped at
every point by the wily old savage it had hoped
to crush, and was ordered to Fort Leavenworth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
where he received his honorable discharge. Then
he went home, and he is there now, living on the
best of terms with everybody, especially David
Evans. Although he was kept in the army long
months beyond his time, he does not complain,
for it gives him the opportunity to refer, when
speaking of his frontier experience, to the "time
when he was with Custer."</p>

<p>George Ackerman is living in his Texas home,
managing his own affairs with the assistance of
an occasional word from Mr. Gilbert, and keeping
up a regular correspondence with his friend Bob
Owens, whom he hopes some day to see at his
ranche again. He has never heard from his uncle
John or from Ned since he parted from them
in Galveston. George has seen some stirring times
during his life, and has learned how to enjoy himself
in a quiet way. He has accumulated a large
fund of stories during his travels, and takes pleasure
in relating them to any attentive listener. Of
all the numerous adventures in which he had borne
a part, he delights most to talk about those that
befell him during his <span class="smcap">life among the soldiers</span>.</p>
